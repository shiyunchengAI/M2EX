The Los Angeles Clippers (19 - 8) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (14 - 14) 106 - 102 on Saturday. Los Angeles has won three of their last four games. Chris Paul paced the team with a game - high 27 points and nine assists. DeAndre Jordan continued his impressive work on the boards, pulling down 16 rebounds, and Blake Griffin and J.J. Redick joined Paul in scoring over 20 points. The Clippers have a tough stretch of their schedule coming up with the Spurs, Hawks, Warriors and Raptors all on this week's docket. Even with the loss, Milwaukee finished their four - game Western Conference road trip 2 - 2, a job well done by the developing squad. In the three games since Jabari Parker went down with a season - ending ACL injury, coach Jason Kidd has cut the umbilical cord they had on Giannis Antetokounmpo. He played over 37 minutes for the second straight game Saturday, which is ten more minutes than his season average of 27 minutes per game. Larry Sanders returned to the starting lineup after sitting out Thursday's game on a league mandated one - game suspension. Ersan Ilyasova (concussion) and John Henson (foot) remain out, and it seems Ilyasova may be closer to returning than Henson.

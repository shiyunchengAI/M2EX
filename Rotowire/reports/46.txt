The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 119 - 98, at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon. The Lakers (19 - 41) generated a renewed sense of optimism with the hiring of the legendary Magic Johnson to the President of Basketball Operations post at the All-Star break, but the harsh reality of an upstart squad has manifested itself since then. Los Angeles has now lost all three games of the Magic era following Sunday's defeat, which saw them get dominated in all phases. The Spurs (45 - 13) shot 52 percent from the field and 48 percent from three - point range, while also eliciting 18 turnovers from their over - matched hosts. Kawhi Leonard led the way for San Antonio with 25 points, which he supplemented with three rebounds and one assist. LaMarcus Aldridge followed with 16 points, nine boards and one assist. Pau Gasol came off the bench to tally 15 points, seven rebounds, one steal and one block. Dewayne Dedmon continued to run with the first unit, supplying 11 points, nine boards, three assists and one steal. Tony Parker generated a near double - double with eight points, nine assists and three rebounds. Patty Mills and Kyle Anderson led the second unit with matching nine - point efforts. Brandon Ingram paced the Lakers with a career - high 22 points, which he supplemented with two rebounds and one block. Jordan Clarkson stepped up with a bench - leading 19 points, along with two rebounds and two assists. D'Angelo Russell was right behind him with 18 points, five boards, three assists and one steal. Julius Randle totaled a modest six points but he also hauled in 12 rebounds and dished out four dimes. Thomas Robinson turned in strong work off the bench with nine points, eight rebounds and four steals. The Spurs head back home to face the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday night, while the Lakers remain home and await the Charlotte Hornets for a Tuesday night showdown.

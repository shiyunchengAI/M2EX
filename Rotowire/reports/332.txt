The Detroit Pistons (20) won their second game in a row to start the regular season, defeating the Utah Jazz (0 - 1) 92 - 87 on Wednesday. The meeting stayed close wire - to - wire, and the Pistons held just a five - point lead at the start of the fourth quarter. Following a Gordon Hayward layup that put the Jazz up 87 - 86 with just 23 seconds left in the game, Detroit was able to counter quickly, as Reggie Jackson made a layup of his own with 17 seconds left that put the Pistons up for good. A pair of free throws from both Jackson and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope ultimately sealed the deal for the home team in Auburn Hills. For the second game in a row to start the season, Andre Drummond led the way for the Pistons, recording a double - double of 18 points (5 - 11 FG, 8 - 11 FT) and 10 rebounds on top of two blocks in 36 minutes. Drummond has recorded a total of 36 points and 29 rebounds to start the season and has clearly established himself as the focal point down low for this Pistons team following the departure of Greg Monroe. Reggie Jackson led all Pistons scorers Wednesday night, scoring 19 points (7 - 14 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 7 FT) on top of four assists in 31 minutes. Caldwell-Pope (16) and Marcus Morris (14) were the other two Detroit starters to score in double figures, while rookie Stanley Johnson added 11 points and five rebounds of his own in 20 minutes off the bench. For the Jazz, Derrick Favors got off to a very strong start to the season and lead the way in the losing effort, scoring a game - high 26 points (10 - 15 FG, 6 - 8 FT) and six rebounds in 35 minutes. Alec Burks served as a solid contributor off the bench, scoring 18 points (6 - 14 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and grabbing six rebounds in 26 minutes. Rodney Hood, who started in favor of Burks at shooting guard, scored just 12 points (6 - 15 FG, 0 - 7 3Pt) in 29 minutes, but managed to dish out a team - high six assists and grab four rebounds. Gordon Hayward rounds out the Utah players in double figures, scoring 13 points (5 - 11 FG) in 35 minutes, while Rudy Gobert remained active on the boards and on defense, recording a team - high 12 rebounds and three blocks while managing just six points. Up next, the Pistons will stay at home to take on the Bulls Friday, while the Jazz will head to Philadelphia Friday to take on the 76ers.

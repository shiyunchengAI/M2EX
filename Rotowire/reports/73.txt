The Jazz had no issues winning on Wednesday, as the team enjoyed a 33 - point blowout of the New Orleans Pelicans. Utah saw strong play from its deep bench, as veteran sixth man Joe Johnson led the team with 27 points, including six three - pointers. Two other members of the Jazz's second unit scored in double figures. Center Rudy Gobert led the team in rebounding with 16, while All-Star forward Gordon Hayward added 17 points to the winning effort. As a team, Utah shot over 54 percent and hit 14 three - pointers and held a 48 - 37 advantage in the rebounding column. New Orleans, meanwhile, saw underwhelming production out of big man Anthony Davis. Davis blocked six shots but was just 4 - of - 12 for 12 points on a night when the Pelicans desperately needed offensive production. The team struggled from beyond the arc, shooting just 5 - of - 20 from three - point range.

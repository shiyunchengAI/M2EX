The Detroit Pistons (36 - 34) defeated the visiting Brooklyn Nets (19 - 50) 115 - 103, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, Saturday. This was the second game of a back - to - back for the Pistons but that has not been a problem for them at all, as they have now won their last six games on the second night of a back - to - back. This was an important win for the Pistons as they remain in competition for the eighth spot in the East. The Nets put up a good fight but the Pistons were more determined down the stretch as they scored 38 points in the final quarter to seal the deal and improve their home record to an impressive 21 - 12. Seven players scored in double digits for Detroit, as the bench chipped in 52 points to help get over the hump on the second night of a back - to - back. Aron Baynes finished with a team - high 21 points (8 - 13 FG, 5 - 5 FT), along with seven rebounds, one assist and one blocked shot, in only 18 minutes off the bench. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope tied a career - high with eight assists, to go along with 11 points and four rebounds, in 39 minutes, while Stanley Johnson finished with 10 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals, in 31 minutes off the bench. The Pistons totaled 30 assists on 46 made field goals, while giving up only eight turnovers. Despite shooting 53 percent from the field, the Nets could not find the momentum to get passed the Pistons. The Nets have now lost five in a row on the road and 14 of 17 overall. Thaddeus Young led the way for Brooklyn, with 24 points (12 - 17 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 0 - 2 FT), nine rebounds, two assists, two blocked shots and one steal, in 26 minutes.

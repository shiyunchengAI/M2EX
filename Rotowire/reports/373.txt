The Indiana Pacers (37 - 43) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (43 - 37) 116 - 104 on Sunday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. While Russell Westbrook did everything he could to bring the Thunder back in this game, he just did n't get enough help in the end, as the Thunder took the loss. This was a tough defeat for the Thunder, as it pushes them to a half - game back from the New Orleans Pelicans for the final projected playoff spot in the West. The Pelicans play the Houston Rockets on Sunday as well, so they could extend their lead to a full game. The Pacers, on the other hand, remain alive in the East with their fifth straight win. They're now even with the Brooklyn Nets for the final playoff spot in the East, although the Nets hold the tie breaker over them, so they'll likely need to win their last two games in order to pass up the Nets. It was C.J. Miles who came up with the huge night on Sunday. He went 9 - for - 14 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 30 points, while also posting 10 rebounds. It was his second impressive performance in a row, as he's combined for 54 points and 15 rebounds over his last two games. The 10 rebounds were a new season - high, with the double - double marking his first of the season. Notching a double - double of his own was Roy Hibbert, who finished with 17 points (7 - 12 FG, 3 - 4 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. The double - double was his third in a row, a stretch where he's averaging 13 points and 11 rebounds per game. Including some clutch buckets during the final few minutes of the game, George Hill added 19 points (6 - 10 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT) and seven assists over 40 minutes. He shot just 2 - of - 6 from the field in Friday's game against the Pistons, so the guard was able to get pointed back in the right direction Sunday. Westbrook did everything he could to try and pick up the win for the Thunder. Westbrook took nearly half of the teams' total shot attempts in this one, recording a ridiculous 43 field goal attempts, while converting on 21 of them. He finished with a monster line of 54 points (21 - 43 FG, 5 - 15 3Pt, 7 - 11 FT), nine rebounds and eight assists over 40 minutes, but he just did n't get enough help from his teammates to convert those impressive numbers into a win. Westbrook has combined for 81 points over his last two games alone. Dion Waiters and Enes Kanter were the only other two Thunder players to reach double figures in points. Waiters posted 16 points (7 - 16 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 0 - 4 FT) and two rebounds, while Kanter recorded 13 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), five rebounds and a block. The Thunder received only 14 points from their bench. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday, while the Thunder will be at home against the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.

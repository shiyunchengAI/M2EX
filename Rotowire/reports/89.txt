The benches were thin Wednesday, but ended up playing a huge factor in the Miami Heat's 108 - 96 win against the Orlando Magic. Four bench players for the Heat combined for 40 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists, while the Magic's three bench players accumulated just 17 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Despite going 0 - for - 4 from the free - throw line, Hassan Whiteside had a strong game, posting 18 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks. The 27 assists on 47 made baskets for Miami shows its new up - tempo offense, as eight of the nine players who played recorded a dime in the win. Serge Ibaka struggled in his debut with the Magic, tallying 14 points and seven rebounds on 6 - for - 17 shooting. In addition, his - 18 plus - minus was the worst in the game. All five starters for Orlando played at least 35 minutes, and this could end up being one of the shortest rotations in the NBA.

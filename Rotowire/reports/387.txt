The Sacramento Kings (21 - 37) defeated the New York Knicks (12 - 47) 124 - 86 on Tuesday at Madison Square Garden in New York. The Kings dominated this game offensively right from the beginning, out - scoring the Knicks 65 - 39 by half, and reaching the 100 - point mark after just the third quarter. Their superior shooting was a big reason for this, as they went 49 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three - point line, while the Knicks finished at 37 percent from the floor and just 18 percent from deep. Along with that, the Kings also secured a 46 - 38 rebounding advantage, only furthering their impressive performance Tuesday. The Kings saw six players reach double figures in this one, along with three reaching the 20 - point plateau. Rudy Gay led the way, going 9 - for - 15 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 25 points, to go along with seven rebounds and four assists in just 26 minutes. He's now shot 40 percent or higher in each of his last four games, a span where he's averaging 23 points and 7 rebounds. DeMarcus Cousins also was a big factor in the win, finishing with 22 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 11 - 11 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. Like Gay, he's been a beast lately, averaging 24 points and 11 rebounds over his last five games. Both players could have put up some even higher numbers in this matchup, but because of the blowout, they were each held to less than 30 minutes on the court. Ben McLemore was also very efficient with his time, scoring 20 points (6 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT) in just 23 minutes. He's picked up his game of late, recording two 20 - point games over his last three, despite averaging just 12 points on the season. Coming off the bench, Derrick Williams and Nik Stauskas reached double figures as well with 17 and 15 points respectively. As shown by their final score, the Knicks struggled to get much going Tuesday, including having all five of their starters combine for just 24 points. With that being said, they did see some solid contributions off their bench. Alexey Shved led the team in scoring, posting 15 points (4 - 11 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 7 - 9 FT), to go along with seven rebounds and three assists in 32 minutes. It was a season - high in minutes for the guard, as he took advantage of the extra time with his second 15 - point showing in a row. Shane Larkin was also one of those bench players who provided some points. He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding six assists and two steals as well. It was just the sixth time all season that he finished in double - digit points. The only other Knick to reach double figures was Jason Smith, who posted 13 points (6 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), four rebounds and three blocked shots in 21 minutes. The Kings' next game will be on the road against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday, while the Knicks will travel to Indiana to play the Pacers on Wednesday.

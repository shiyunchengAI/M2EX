The Charlotte Hornets (24 - 25) dealt the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers (35 - 13) their second loss under coach Tyronn Lue on Wednesday, winning 106 - 97 in Charlotte. Despite a severe slide to start the new year, Charlotte remains in the mix for the Eastern Conference playoffs. The team has now won five or their last seven games, including a 101 - 82 blowout of the Los Angeles Lakers. The Hornets hold one of the largest disparities between home and road record in the league, as they are now 17 - 8 at Time Warner Cable Arena but just 7 - 17 away from their home court. On Wednesday, guard Jeremy Lin earned props from owner and NBA legend Michael Jordan for his strong performance. Lin delivered 24 points, five rebounds and eight assists, leading the team in both scoring and dimes dished. Recently returned defensive anchor Michael Kidd-Gilchrist delivered an 11 - point, 13 - rebound double double, while rookie lottery pick Frank Kaminsky provided a spark off the bench with 15 points. Cleveland, meanwhile, struggled to move the ball, recording just 16 team assists. Power forward Kevin Love was held to a paltry 4 - for - 12 from the field, while shooting guard JR Smith also went cold, going just 5 - for - 14 on the night. The non - Love members of the big three still put up a strong fight, however, with Kyrie Irving scoring a team - high 26 points and LeBron James going for 23 points, six rebounds, and six assists. The Cavaliers will host the Celtics on Friday. Charlotte will also see action on Friday, as they play host to the Miami Heat.

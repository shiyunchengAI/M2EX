The Phoenix Suns (13 - 29) saw their woes continue on Sunday after being blown out 117 - 87 by the Minnesota Timberwolves (13 - 29). While the Suns' slide continued, the Timberwolves were able to turn their recent bad luck around. Coming into Sunday's matchup, the Wolves had dropped 13 of their last 14 games. One would not have guessed that based on Sunday's game, however, as the Timberwolves shot 57 percent from the field while out - rebounding the Suns 41 - 30. The Wolves also had a huge advantage at the free - throw line, knocking down 31 of a whopping 40 free - throw attempts as opposed to the Suns' paltry 14 for 25. Minnesota's pair of first - overall picks shone brightly in just 50 combined minutes, with Andrew Wiggins delivering 18 points to go with four assists and four rebounds and Karl-Anthony Towns going for 14 points, eight rebounds, and three blocks. The Suns now stand in a similar position to Minnesota, having lost 13 of their last 14. Phoenix's downward spiral has been due in large part to star point guard Eric Bledsoe's season - ending meniscus injury. The guard was averaging 20 points per game and also sat in the top 10 in the NBA in steals per game prior to his injury. On Sunday, the team simply failed to click on all levels, shooting just 43 percent including a disastrous 20 percent from beyond the arc. Phoenix had major issues with ball movement, racking up just 16 assists on the night. The Suns' next matchup will be against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday. Minnesota, meanwhile, will travel to New Orleans on Tuesday to take on the Pelicans.

The Los Angeles Clippers took down the host Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, 133 - 109. The Clippers (43 - 29) came off a convincing win on Monday by blowing out their hometown rival Lakers on Tuesday. The starting backcourt of Chris Paul and J.J. Redick was dominant, with Paul pouring in 27 points and Redick adding 24. Perimeter play was the driving force of the dominant win, as the Clips shot over 53 percent from the field while sinking 15 three - pointers. Another area in which the Clippers thrived was free - throw shooting; the team reached the line 32 times and hit a whopping 28 free - throws on the night. The Lakers (20 - 51) are on a six - game losing streak and appear to be right where they want to be, as the team shut down many of its veterans for the remainder of the season in part due to desire to keep their own draft pick. Tuesday's loss at Staples Center was a particularly brutal one, however, as the team fell to its divisional rival on its home court. The team shot just 63 percent from the free - throw line and went an abysmal 5 - of - 19 from beyond the arc. One bright spot for the Lakers, however, was rookie Brandon Ingram, who led the team with 21 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting. The Clippers will visit Dallas on Thursday, while the Lakers will host the Timberwolves on Friday.

The Los Angeles Clippers (29 - 14) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (18 - 25) in dominating fashion Thursday 123 - 84. This game was essentially over before the buzzer sounded to end the first half as the Clippers were nearly doubling up the Nets 70 - 37. Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan combined for 34 points and 16 rebounds in the first half and Chris Paul had 12 assists in the first two quarters as well. The Clippers have scored over 115 points in three of their last four games and shot a season - high 59% from the floor. The Nets came out flat after a 103 - 100 victory in Sacramento on Wednesday and were further flattened by a Clippers team that absolutely steamrolled them. Mason Plumlee was the only starter to score in double figures as they were held to just 37% from the floor, including 4 - for - 21 from beyond the arc. The Nets will look to shake this one off Saturday in Utah. The Clippers easily cruised to its third consecutive victory Thursday as they handled the Nets. Doc Rivers pulled most of his starters mid - way through the third quarter, giving valuable minutes to his role players. His son, Austin Rivers, saw the most playing time he has had in a Clipper uniform, logging 23 minutes and putting up nine points, four rebounds, and six assists. The Clippers have just one home game between now and Feb. 11 and will next take floor Sunday in Phoenix.

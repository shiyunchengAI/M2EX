The Denver Nuggets (12 - 15) defeated the Indiana Pacers (8 - 19) 76 - 73 on Saturday. Denver is on a two - game win streak. Ty Lawson led the way with 15 points and 10 assists for a double - double. Danilo Gallinari got in on the fun off the bench, scoring a team - high 19 points in 28 minutes. Both teams struggled to put the ball in the basket. Denver shot just 37 percent from the field, but they gained an advantage by holding the Pacers to an even worse 31 percent shooting. Indiana has lost two straight and ten of their last 11 games. They had just three players score in double figures Saturday, with David West scoring a team - high 19 points to go along with ten rebounds and five assists. Starting center Roy Hibbert continues to struggle in his return from a sprained ankle. He got into foul trouble Saturday that limited him to zero points and five rebounds in 24 minutes. The Pacers will finish their road trip against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday.

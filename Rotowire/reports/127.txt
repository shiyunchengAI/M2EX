The Toronto Raptors (46 - 32) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33 - 45) 92 - 74 on Wednesday in Charlotte. The Raptors were dominant Monday night from start to finish, and while late in the fourth quarter it appeared as if the Hornets were looking to make one last push, Toronto had little trouble closing it out. DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto, scoring 18 points (6 - 16 FG, 6 - 7 FT), to go along with seven assists and three blocks in 31 minutes. Lou Williams provided solid scoring off the bench, putting up 16 points (5 - 15 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt) in 26 minutes. Despite their performances, the two still shot rather poorly, going a combined 11 - of - 31 from the field. Greivis Vasquez got the start once again with Lowry continuing to sit out with a back injury, and he matched Williams' 16 points (6 - 13 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt), while also recording five rebounds and four assists in 36 minutes. Amir Johnson missed his second consecutive game. Tyler Hansbrough got the start and logged a double - double with 12 points and 12 rebounds in 37 minutes. With the win, Toronto tied the Chicago Bulls for third place in the Eastern Conference, although the Raptors own the tie breaker so they currently sit above them. The Hornets struggled to get anything going Monday night. Kemba Walker was the only starter who scored in double figures with 15 points (5 - 13 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt), to go along with four rebounds and just three assists. The only other Charlotte players to score in double figures were the team's two point guards off the bench, with Mo Williams and Brian Roberts each scoring 10 points on a combined 8 - of - 20 shooting. As a team, Charlotte shot a dreadful 35 percent percent from the field, and the loss really hurts their playoff chances, as they are now three games behind the Celtics for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East. Up next, the Raptors will travel to Orlando on Friday and play the Magic, while the Hornets will head to Atlanta Friday to take on the East-leading Hawks.

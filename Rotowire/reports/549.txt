The Atlanta Hawks defeated the visiting Houston Rockets 112 - 97, Saturday night at Philips Arena. The Hawks (4 - 2) put together their highest scoring first half of the young season, with 65 points in the first 24 minutes. Through 48 minutes they shot 53 percent from the field and 40 percent from deep, while holding the Rockets to 43 percent from the field. Atlanta dominated inside, with 62 points in the paint, in large part thanks to Dwight Howard and Paul Millsap, who combined for 43 points. Howard was huge against his former team, finishing with 20 points, 14 rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal, in 29 minutes. Millsap added 23 points, 11 rebounds, five steals, and four assists, in 34 minutes. Kent Bazemore had his best game so far this season, with 20 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals, in 32 minutes. The Hawks are now 3 - 1 at home but will have their work cut - out for them as they enter Cleveland to face the defending champs on Tuesday. The Rockets (3 - 3) started out well but began to unravel in the second half, where they were out - scored 47 - 38. They were held to 13 free throw attempts, which is almost as many as James Harden is capable of earning on his own on any average night. Harden continued his strong point - guard play, with 30 points, 12 assists, nine rebounds and three steals, in 37 minutes. Harden did not have a ton of offensive support as the next highest scorer for Houston was K.J. McDaniels, who added 13 points off the bench. Ryan Anderson added 12 points, while Clint Capela another 12 points along with 10 rebounds. The Rockets bench only chipped in 24 points in total, while the team's 25 turnovers stand - out as a major issue. The Rockets will move on to Washington for their next contest, Monday.

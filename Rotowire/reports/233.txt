The Detroit Pistons (24 - 43) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (47 - 21) 105 - 95 on Tuesday at the Palace of Auburn Hills. Coming close to playing themselves completely out of the playoffs after losing 10 games in a row, the Pistons gave themselves some hope Tuesday, as they came out with a 10 - point win over the Grizzlies. The win brings them within six and half games of the Miami Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference, but they will still need to keep on winning with just 15 games left in the season. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, continue to sit as the second seed in the West, seven games behind the Golden State Warriors, but just one and a half games ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. They've lost five of their last ten games now, but they will still likely finish in the top half of the standings if they do n't go on some extended losing streak in the near future. A big part of the win should be attributed to the Pistons' defense, as they forced the Grizzlies into 18 turnovers, while committing just nine of their own. Reggie Jackson led the way on the offensive side of the ball though, scoring 23 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), while also handing out a ridiculous season - high of 20 assists. It was only his third game posting double - digit assists this season, while this arguably marked his best game since joining the Pistons at the trade deadline. Andre Drummond notched a double - double of his own, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 6 FT), 16 rebounds and five blocked shots. He had suffered a concussion during Saturday's game, but cleared the concussion protocol prior to this matchup and played as if there were no lingering problems. With Greg Monroe sitting out due to a knee injury, Anthony Tolliver moved into the starting lineup. He took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points (4 - 12 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and seven rebounds. After failing to reach double - digit points in nine straight games, he's now gone two straight with 14 points or more. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had a solid shooting effort as well and added 24 points (10 - 16 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) in 37 minutes. With Mike Conley sidelined due to an ankle injury, it was the Grizzlies' frontcourt that had the most production, despite still suffering the loss. Gasol posted a double - double with 17 points (6 - 11 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), 11 rebounds and six assists. He had scored less than his season average of 18 points per game in each of his last three outings, so it was good to see the center get back on track Tuesday. Jeff Green was locked in with his shot, going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 21 points. He's now pushed his season averages to 15 points and 4 rebounds on the year. Zach Randolph and Vince Carter were the only other players in double figures for points. Randolph finished with 13 points (6 - 13 FG, 1 - 1 FT) and five rebounds, while Carter had 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds off the bench. The Pistons' next game will be on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday, while the Grizzlies will travel to Dallas to play the Mavericks on Friday.

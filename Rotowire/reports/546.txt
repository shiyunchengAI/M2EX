The Warriors (29 - 5) handed the Cavaliers (19 - 18) their fourth straight loss Friday night, winning 112 - 94 at Oracle Arena. Golden State pulled away late, outscoring Cleveland by 10 in the fourth quarter capped by an 11 - 2 run to end the game. All five Warriors starters scored in double - figures, led by a combined 47 points from Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Curry added 10 assists while Thompson drilled four three - pointers. Marreese Speights added 12 points and eight rebounds, and Draymond Green nearly missed a triple - double, putting up 10 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, though he was 0 - of - 8 from beyond the arc. Andrew Bogut continued to come off the bench, playing 20 minutes and scoring four points to go with five rebounds and three assists. Cleveland, still without LeBron James (knee), got 23 points from Kyrie Irving and 17 from Kevin Love, but it wasn’t enough, as the Cavs shot only 41 percent from the floor as a team. New acquisition J.R. Smith got the start at shooting guard, as coach David Blatt shifted Matthew Dellavedova back to the bench. Smith played a team - high 42 minutes and finished with a game - high 27 points (11 - 23 FG). Up next, the Cavaliers head to Sacramento to face the Kings on Sunday night. Golden State has a few days off before hitting the road to play the Jazz in Salt Lake City on Tuesday.

The Golden State Warriors fell to the San Antonio Spurs 113 - 100 Thursday at the ORACLE Arena, despite shooting an impressive 54 percent from the field. In the second game of a back - to - back, coach Gregg Popovich uncharacteristically opted to play his veterans, and it paid off in a big way. Tim Duncan had himself a double - double in the contest, with 12 points (5 - 13 FG, 2 - 3 FT) and 13 rebounds; he added three assists and two turnovers, while turning the ball over once. Tony Parker posted an equally impressive line of 28 points (11 - 17 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), seven assists, one rebound, and one turnover in 30 minutes of action. Warriors' guard Klay Thompson exploded Thursday for 29 points (9 - 17 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT). His effort was n't enough, though, as Golden State turned the ball over way too frequently, finishing with a total of 19 as a team. Harrison Barnes chipped in with a season - high 22 points (9 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and Stephen Curry added 16 (7 - 18 FG, 0 - 7 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT). Curry did not score in the second half. The San Antonio Spurs attempted an astounding 23 more shots from the field than the Golden State Warriors in this matchup.The Warriors will play next at home against the Brooklyn Nets Thursday, while the Spurs will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday.

Point guard George Hill returned from a toe injury in Thursday's game between the Jazz and 76ers, and played as though he had n't missed any time at all. Hill led Utah with 21 points, shooting a ridiculous 8 - of - 10 from the field with two three - pointers. Hill added eight rebounds and six assists and came away with three steals on the defensive end. Defensive anchor Rudy Gobert, meanwhile, had two blocks and two steals while leading the team with 13 rebounds. Wings Gordon Hayward and Rodney Hood scored 20 points each, and the Jazz finished the night with 15 three - pointers and over 47 percent shooting from the field. For the Sixers, meanwhile, the game was much less eventful. Forward Ersan Ilyasova led the team with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Rookie Joel Embiid, however, sat the game out for rest, and no other Sixer scored more than 14.

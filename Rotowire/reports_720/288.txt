The Indiana Pacers (30 - 34) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (34 - 31) ,109 - 103, on Thursday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. In a matchup between the East's sixth and seventh seeds, Milwaukee and Indiana went back and forth all the way through overtime, but the Pacers outlasted the Bucks. Milwaukee went on an 11 - 2 run to cut the Pacers' lead from 10 to one midway through the fourth quarter. From there, Milwaukee had an answer every time Indiana tried to pull away. Ersan Ilyasova had his 11th point of the fourth quarter to tie it at 96, but could n't convert the second free throw to give Milwaukee the lead. Luis Scola was huge off the bench with 17 points and 15 rebounds, including a jumper that helped spark a 90 Pacers run in overtime. Indiana has taken two out of three in the season series with Milwaukee. They will meet for the final time in the regular season in two weeks. Milwaukee faltered in overtime to drop the second half of a back - to - back set. Michael Carter-Williams had his best game as a member of the Bucks with 28 points, 12 rebounds, and two steals. O.J Mayo and Jerryd Bayless were both sidelined for this contest, which allowed Tyler Ennis to play 15 minutes, although he only managed six points and four assists in that span. Milwaukee returns to action Saturday in Memphis. The Pacers have now won a season - high seven games in a row and nine of their last ten. Roy Hibbert was sidelined with an elbow injury, but Ian Mahinmi filled in admirably as the rim protector. Mahinmi finished with 10 boards and four blocks in 29 minutes before fouling out in overtime. Rodney Stuckey continued his scoring tear with a team - high 23 points in 37 minutes off the bench. The Pacers resume play Saturday when they host the Celtics.

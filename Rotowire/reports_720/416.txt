The Boston Celtics (13 - 23) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (18 - 19) 108 - 100 on Monday at the TD Garden in Boston. After coming out of the third quarter down 76 - 72, the Celtics did n't look to be in the best of positions. With a huge fourth quarter though, where the Celtics out - scored the Pelicans 36 - 24, they were able to secure the eight point victory at home in front of their home crowd. The Celtics forced the Pelicans into 18 turnovers, while committing only 11 of their own, which may have been the difference in this game. The Celtics received most of their production from their forward position, as Jae Crowder and Jared Sullinger both had strong performances. Sullinger led the team, scoring 27 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 8 - 9 FT) and grabbing 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. The 27 points were a season - high for him, while it marked his second double - double in as many games. Crowder on the other hand posted 22 points (9 - 14 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), three assists, four steals and two blocks. While the 22 points were a season - high for him, so were the blocks and steals, as he was a huge contributor on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball Monday. The Celtics did receive plenty of help from their bench as well. Marcus Thornton had 13 points (2 - 8 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 8 - 9 FT) in only 14 minutes, while Brandon Bass had 12 points (4 - 10 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) in 23 minutes. Both Avery Bradley and Evan Turner also reached double figures with 10 points apiece. Despite the loss, the Pelicans received another huge performance from Anthony Davis. Davis went 10 - for - 23 from the floor to score 34 points, while also adding nine rebounds and three blocked shots. He was able to get to the line at will in this game, converting on 14 - of - 15 free throws. He's had the hot hand lately, averaging 29 points and 10 rebounds per game over his last three outings. Eric Gordon had arguably his best game of the season, going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 21 points. It was a season - high in points for him, as he's dealt with injuries for a large portion of the year. Coming off the bench with Gordon back in the starting lineup, Tyreke Evans still had a strong showing. He chipped in with 19 points (7 - 15 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and eight rebounds, playing just under 35 minutes because Jrue Holiday was forced from the game after only 15 minutes with a right ankle injury. The Celtics' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will be on the road against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday.

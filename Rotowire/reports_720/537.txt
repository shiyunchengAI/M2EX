This was the third win in four games for the Timberwolves, as they were able to halt Toronto's three - game win streak. This was an important bounce - back win for the young'Wolves after they fell to the Pelicans last Monday.

Toronto only assisted on 19 of its 39 field goals and racked up 34 personal fouls, as the Raptors were unable to hold any type of momentum.

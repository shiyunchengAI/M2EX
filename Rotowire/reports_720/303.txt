2016 ended on a high note for the NBA, and 2017 has picked up right where the league left off. The NBA saw 50 - point outings from Boston's Isaiah Thomas and Houston's James Harden on the last two days of 2016, and on Monday, just two days later, Jimmy Butler delivered the first 50 - point game of the New Year. Butler scored 52 points on 15 - of - 24 from the field and a ridiculous 21 - of - 22 from the free - throw line. Chicago as a team shot just 46 percent and had no other player score over 12. Butler, however, was able to single - handedly carry his team to victory, as he also recorded a team - high 12 rebounds and six assists. On Charlotte's side, star point guard Kemba Walker also kicked off 2017 in a big way. Walker scored 34 points, including six three - pointers, and also grabbed 11 rebounds. The team shot an impressive 49 percent and had nine three - pointers, but turning the ball over 14 times while forcing just nine ended up making a difference in what was a close game.

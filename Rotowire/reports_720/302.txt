The Washington Wizards took game one of their series with the Toronto Raptors, 93 - 86, in overtime Saturday at the Air Canada Centre. The opening game of the 2015 playoffs was a tightly contested, back and forth affair that could n't be decided in just four quarters. Paul Pierce, who was Toronto's kryptonite a season ago as a member of the Nets, had another huge playoff outing. Pierce finished with a game - high 20 points on 7 - of - 10 shooting, including the go - ahead three pointer in overtime. Toronto mustered just four points in overtime to finish with just 86 points, which is well below its season average of 104 points. The Raptors are now 0 - 7 in opening games of the first round. Game two will take place Tuesday in Toronto before the series moves to Washington on Friday. Washington was 0 - 3 against Toronto during the regular season, but Paul Pierce and a combination of strong outings from its big men helped lead the Wizards to victory. Nene Hilario, who had been hampered by an ankle injury, posted a double - double with 12 points and 13 rebounds. John Wall and Bradley Beal had underwhelming shooting performances, but they made solid contributions in other facets of the game. Still, the Wizards will need their young guards to improve their shooting efficiency to maintain the advantage in the series. Toronto was stifled on the offensive end, shooting just 38 percent from the floor as it dropped the opening game of the series. Kyle Lowry had a frustrating game with just seven points on 2 - of - 10 shooting before fouling out. The Raptors also struggled on the boards as they were out - rebounded by 13. Outside of DeMar DeRozan's 15 points, the Raptors' starters combined for just 23 points. The Raptors will need Lowry and the rest of their starters to bounce back in order to even the series at one game apiece on Tuesday.

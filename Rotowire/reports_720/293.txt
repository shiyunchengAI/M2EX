The Los Angeles Lakers (21 - 58) beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (16 - 63) 106 - 98 on Friday. Ryan Kelly showed off his passing skills from the frontcourt against Minnesota. He finished with seven assists to go along with 21 points and four rebounds. Jordan Clarkson has been one of very few bright spots for the Lakers in what has been a dreadful season. He put up 18 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in a dominant performance against a youthful Timberwolves squad. Los Angeles only sent eight players to the court tonight so many of them put of nice statistical lines. Jabari Brown had 20 points and seven assists as well. Los Angeles ended a five - game losing streak. After the Dallas Mavericks, the Lakers will play their two final games against the Sacramento Kings. Andrew Wiggins proved again why he was the number one overall selection in last summer's draft, as well as how much his game has matured since the beginning of the season. He had a monster game against the Lakers, with 29 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. However it was n't enough to end his team's eight game losing streak, that initially started with a 101 - 99 loss in overtime against the Lakers back on Mar. 25. The Golden State Warriors will host the Timberwolves on Saturday, as the Lakers will welcome the Dallas Mavericks to the Staples Center on Sunday.

It was another monster day for Cleveland's big three consisting of LeBron James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, as they combined to score 79 of the teams 128 points Thursday night. This has been nothing new for the Cavaliers' stars this season, as they are scoring a combined 70 points per game through the first five game of the season. If the big three can continue to score at this high of a rate, especially Kevin Love, this team will give defenses problem all year. For the Celtics, the story of the game from them was rookie wing Jaylen Brown's explosion in the box score amidst his start in the place of an injured Jae Crowder. After scoring a combined 27 points in his first four games as a pro, Brown made the most of his 35 minutes of playing time, scoring 19 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting from the field, which included three 3 - pointers.

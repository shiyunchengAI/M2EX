The San Antonio Spurs (2 - 1) rolled to a 100 - 73 win over the Los Angeles Clippers (1 - 2). Kawhi Leonard began the night accepting his Defensive Player of the Year award, and then added offensive maestro to his repertoire before the end of the third quarter. He scored a career - high 32 points in 29 minutes and hounded the Clippers’ Blake Griffin on the defensive end. Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, and Manu Ginobili all combined for 12 points in the lopsided victory. On the eve of his 39th birthday, Duncan was the only Spur to play more than 30 minutes, noteworthy because he played 44 minutes in Game 2. After being ruled out prior to the game with an ankle injury, Aron Baynes surprisingly played the final seven minutes. The Clippers set franchise playoff record - lows with 73 points, 34 percent field goal accuracy, and a playoff - worse 27 - point loss. The league’s best regular season offense on a possession basis was limited to 11 third - quarter points, concluding the first three periods with 49 points. Blake Griffin finished the game with team - highs of 14 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and 15 shot attempts, nearly recording his second straight triple - double. Chris Paul, the league’s steadiest ballhandler, registered six turnovers in 33 minutes and shot 3 - of - 11 from the floor. J.J. Redick scored all seven of his points in the first quarter, and Jamal Crawford was held to 1 - of - 11 shooting. Austin Rivers finished second on the team in scoring with 11 points, most of which were recorded in garbage time. Both teams resume the series Sunday afternoon in the AT & T Center.

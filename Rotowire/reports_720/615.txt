The Orlando Magic (10 - 16) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (16 - 7) 100 - 99 on Saturday. The Magic and Hawks were playing a home - and - home set Friday and Saturday. Atlanta took Friday's game 87 - 81, but Orlando was reinforced by the return of starting center Nikola Vucevic on Saturday to give them a more stout lineup. Vucevic missed six games with a lower back injury, but in his return, he posted 18 points and 11 rebounds in 35 minutes to show that he's back to full health. Orlando snapped a two - game losing streak with the win and have won three of their last five. The Magic will embark on a two - game road trip that begins on Monday against the Toronto Raptors. Atlanta had their nine - game win streak snapped with Saturday's loss. They had trouble getting their shots to fall, finishing shooting just 42 percent from the field and 30 percent from beyond the arc. Jeff Teague scored a game - high 24 points and dished out eight assists, but his success did n't spread amongst the rest of the Hawks. They'll try to get back in the win column when they host the Chicago Bulls on Monday.

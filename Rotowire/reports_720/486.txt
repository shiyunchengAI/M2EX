The San Antonio Spurs (50 - 26) continued their dominant play Friday with a 123 - 93 thrashing of the Denver Nuggets (28 - 48) at the AT & T Center. With the middle of the West's playoff picture wide open, San Antonio is making a push for a top - four seed. The Spurs took over from the early going, taking a 45 - 25 lead into the second quarter. Their ball movement was too much for the Nuggets to handle as the Spurs dished out 33 assists on 47 made baskets. The Nuggets were also hampered by 18 turnovers against 17 assists. With Friday's win, the Spurs completed the season sweep over the Nuggets. Denver appeared to be turning things around under interim coach Melvin Hunt with a four game winning streak in mid - March, but has struggled since then. The Nuggets are just 2 - 7 since that winning streak, including a current three game skid. Danilo Gallinari bounced back from a couple of shaky outings to post a team - high 20 points on 8 - of - 12 shooting. J.J Hickson (knee) returned from a one game absence, finishing with four points and six rebounds over 24 minutes off the bench. The Nuggets will play their next two games in Los Angeles, starting with a matchup with the Clippers on Saturday. San Antonio has regained its status as a team to be reckoned with in the West, going 9 - 1 over its last 10 games. No one player lit up the scoreboard Friday, but the Spurs had five players (including three reserves) score in double figures. The Spurs shot 55 percent from the floor and 41 percent from beyond the arc as they were able to put the game out of reach. San Antonio will get a chance to prove itself against the West's top team, Golden State, on Sunday.

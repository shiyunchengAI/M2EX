The Houston Rockets (24 - 11) defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers (19 - 17) 105 - 93 on Wednesday at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland. After ending the third quarter down 74 - 73, the Rockets came out and had a strong fourth quarter, out - scoring the Cavaliers by an impresive 32 - 19 mark, allowing them to steal the victory on the road in Cleveland. The Rockets were able to out - rebound the Cavaliers 50 - 37, only furthering their advantage in this one. Like he's done so many times already this season, James Harden led the Rockets to this victory. He came close to a triple - double, finishing with 21 points (6 - 18 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT), seven rebounds and nine assists. He did turn the ball over seven times though, so he'll need to cut those down in the near future. As expected, Dwight Howard was able to use his size advantage over Tristan Thompson and the Cavaliers' bigs. He went off for 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 5 - 11 FT) and 19 rebounds, marking his third double - double in a row. He's averaged 17 points and 15 rebounds over that stretch of three games. Trevor Ariza was able to do it on both sides of the ball, recording 13 points (5 - 13 FG, 3 - 10 3Pt), six rebounds and five steals. He's had a tremendous amount of steals over his last three games, combining for 14 over that period. The Rockets did have solid contributions off their bench as well with Josh Smith scoring 16 points (7 - 10 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 1 - 4 FT) and Corey Brewer adding 12 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT). The Cavaliers got most of their production out of their two superstars, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Irving had the biggest contribution, going 15 - for - 26 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 38 points. The points were a season - high for him as well, as he's continued to get off the bulk of the shots with LeBron James still sitting out. Love on the other hand notched another double - double, finishing with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 16 rebounds. It marked his third double - double in a row, where he's averaged 25 points and 15 rebounds between those games. The only other Cavalier to reach double - digit points was Tristan Thompson, who added 11 points (2 - 7 FG, 7 - 7 FT) and six rebounds of his own. The Cavaliers' bench combined for only 13 points. The Rockets' next game will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Thursday, while the Cavaliers will travel to Oakland to play the Golden State Warriors on Friday.

The Chicago Bulls defeated the host Milwaukee Bucks, 109 - 94, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Sunday. Milwaukee was expected to win this game easily, but Chicago rode a huge third quarter en route to an upset win. In fact, the Bulls outscored the Bucks, 35 - 24 in the third quarter and held the lead for the final 20 minutes. Rebounding was a huge factor, with the Bulls winning that battle, 49 - 34. Chicago also dominated the shooting, as they hit 54 percent from the field and 48 percent from three, while the Bucks shot just 44 percent from the field and 30 percent from long range. The 33 assists recorded from Chicago obliterated the 20 assists the Bucks handed out as well.

Khris Middleton totaled 14 points, six rebounds and four steals, while Malcolm Brogdon finished with 14 points, four rebounds and four assists.

Dwight Howard returned to action Saturday after missing the Rockets' last 11 games with a knee injury. He was supposed to be limited to 24 minutes in the game, but Howard persevered to play 30 minutes and put up a monstrous double - double of 26 points and 13 rebounds. Joining Howard in on the fun was James Harden with a triple - double of 24 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 38 minutes. The Rockets' formidable defense held the Nuggets to just 38 percent shooting from the field. Houston will face the Nuggets again in their next game, going on the road to Denver for their game on Wednesday. Denver has lost four of their last five games as they struggle to find footing during a tough part of their schedule. Kenneth Faried came off the bench for a second straight game, with J.J. Hickson staying in the starting lineup at power forward. Denver matched up well with the Rockets on Saturday, but they simply could n't hit their shots. Even at the free - throw line, the Nuggets shot just 65 percent. Denver will begin a four - game homestead hosting the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday.

These two teams have really struggled this season and the 48 combined turnovers shows just that. Denver was the more inept team though, as they set an NBA season - high with 29 turnovers of their own. The shooting was n't any better, as they shot 41 percent from the field, 67 percent from the free - throw line and 22 percent from three - point range. Bradley Beal was the best player in this game, tallying 26 points, three rebounds and five assists. John Wall went just 5 - of - 14 from the field, but still finished with 15 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals. Markieff Morris also scored 15 points, as all five starters played at least 33 minutes. Nikola Jokic was the only effective Nugget on offense, finishing with 17 points and 11 rebounds. Wilson Chandler had a game to forget, as he went just 2 - of - 16 from the field, en route to five points.

The Miami Heat defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves, 115 - 113, at Target Center on Monday. Late in the contest, with 17 seconds left, the Heat (22 - 30) held an eight - point lead and were seemingly well on their way to their 11th straight victory. But then, a couple of Miami turnovers and a few big plays from Andrew Wiggins later, the Timberwolves (19 - 33) had one last chance to either tie or take the lead with eight seconds remaining in the game. However, Wiggins' fallaway mid - range jumper would not go down and the time would expire, and the Heat's miraculous win streak remained alive. In the end, it was the Goran Dragic show in Minneapolis, with the point guard hitting nearly everything he threw up and finishing with a team - high 33 points on 13 - of - 17 shooting from the field and 7 - of - 9 shooting from behind the arc on top of nine assists. And that hot shooting was contagious, as the rest of the Miami players launched from three - point land with plenty of confidence and the team shot an astounding 54 percent from long range, solidifying them as one of the hottest teams in basketball. As for Minnesota, they got impressive performances out of their two stars in Karl-Anthony Towns and Wiggins, but they were unable to walk away with the victory in their second game without Zach LaVine, who is out for the season with a torn ACL. Towns finished with a game - high 35 points and eight rebounds, while Wiggins' late - game heroics and a 21 - point second half led to him finishing with 27 points on 11 - of - 23 shooting from the field. Ricky Rubio also had yet another double - double, scoring 14 rebounds and dishing out 13 assists. Overall, it was an efficient game for the Timberwolves, who shot 54 percent from the field, but it ended up just being too little too late. Up next, the Heat will look to make it 12 straight wins Wednesday against the Bucks, while the Timberwolves will look to avoid their fifth straight loss Wednesday against the Raptors.

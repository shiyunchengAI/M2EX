The Washington Wizards (26 - 12) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (23 - 16) 101 - 93 on Tuesday at the Verizon Center in Washington. After ending the third quarter up just 75 - 72, the Wizards were able to go on a fourth quarter run, out - scoring the Spurs 26 - 21 to secure the eight point victory in front of their home crowd. The Wizards were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three - point line, while the Spurs went 40 percent from the floor and just 31 percent from beyond the arc. John Wall led the Wizards, going 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 25 points, while adding eight assists and two blocks as well. He's recorded at least eight assists in each of his last nine games, as he continues to find his teammates at a high rate. Bradley Beal did n't have his best night from the field, but finished with 13 points (4 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), five rebounds, three assists, two steals and two blocked shots. He did a little bit of everything in this game, getting involved on not only the offensive side of the ball, but the defensive side as well. The Wizards received a strong effort from their bench. Kevin Seraphin recorded 17 points (6 - 8 FG, 5 - 5 FT) and eight rebounds while Kris Humphries had 10 points (5 - 10 FG) and eight rebounds of his own. Finally nearing a full games worth of minutes after coming back from a hamstring injury a week ago, Tony Parker got the start and led the team in scoring with 14 points (7 - 18 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt), while adding two assists in 30 minutes. Ever since returning a week ago, his minutes have slowly increased and this marked his first 30 minute game in his last five outings. Tim Duncan recorded a double - double, finishing with 11 points (5 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 FT) and 12 rebounds in 25 minutes. It marked his eighteenth double - double of the season thus far. Patty Mills came off the bench and added 12 points (4 - 8 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt) in slightly over 24 minutes. He still received a good portion of minutes in relief of Tony Parker. Both Tiago Splitter and Danny Green reached double figures as well with 10 points apiece. The Wizards' next game will be on the road against the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday, while the Spurs will travel to Charlotte to play the Hornets on Wednesday.

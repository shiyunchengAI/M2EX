The Chicago Bulls defeated the Boston Celtics, 104 - 103, at United Center on Thursday. In the final game before the All-Star break, these two teams left it all on the floor. In fact, there were eight ties and 14 lead changes, with neither team leading by more than 10 points. Jimmy Butler was the hero, as he hit two clutch free - throws with less than a second left to seal the win. Free-throw shooting was a key for Chicago all night, as they went a perfect 22 - of - 22 from the free - throw line. Rebounding was the decisive statistic though, with the Bulls winning that differential, 51 - 31. The Celtics (37 - 20) have been one of the hottest teams over recent weeks, but they'll head into the All-Star break with a devastating loss. Isaiah Thomas led the team once again, as he tallied 29 points, three rebounds and seven assists. No other starter had more than 10 points, with Marcus Smart, Al Horford and Jae Crowder combining to go 7 - of - 22 from the field. Kelly Olynyk came off the bench to provide 17 points, seven rebounds and four assists. The Bulls (28 - 29) are slowly climbing back to .500 and this win may be what they need to go on a run over the final couple months.

Robin Lopez fell just shy of a double - double, totaling 15 points and eight rebounds. Rajon Rondo had a strange line, as he went scoreless, but grabbed seven rebounds and dished out eight assists off the bench.

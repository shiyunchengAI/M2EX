If you told the Knicks that they'd lose Derrick Rose to injury, have Carmelo Anthony shoot 20 percent and see Kristaps Porzingis foul out, it likely would n't be a pretty result. Despite all that, New York overcame a double - digit deficit in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime, but still could n't quite prevail. The key to victory for the Suns was defense, as they held the Knicks to 39 percent shooting and out - rebounded them, 61 - 43. Despite fouling out, Porzingis led the team with 34 points, eight rebounds, three steals and three blocks in the loss. Kyle O'Quinn was huge off the bench for New York, totaling 22 points and 14 rebounds. Eric Bledsoe was the Suns best player, accumulating 31 points, six rebounds and eight assists. Tyson Chandler was a monster down low, scoring 13 points and snatching down a season - high 23 rebounds. Both Devin Booker and Carmelo Anthony struggled big time, as Anthony went 3 - of - 15 and Booker went 3 - of - 16.

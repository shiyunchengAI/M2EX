The Portland Trail Blazers (8 - 12) took the lead with a 41 - point third quarter Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers (12 - 6) and held on for the 123 - 111 victory at the Moda Center. Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard scored 11 of his 26 points in the third quarter. With 6:52 remaining in the period, Lillard knocked down one of his five three - pointers of the game to give Portland a 74 - 71 lead, a lead they would not relinquish. Lillard's 26 points led Portland, and his eight assists were a game high. Backcourt mate C.J. McCollum added 21 points, five rebounds and five assists. Allen Crabbe tied his career high set on Tuesday with 18 points off the bench. He shot 4 - 5 from three - point land, helping the Trail Blazers shoot a robust 18 - 36 from deep on the night. Pacers guard C.J. Miles caught fire from three as well, as he poured in 27 points to lead Indiana, fueled by eight three - pointers. George Hill scored 18 points and Ian Mahinmi notched a double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds, but Pacers superstar Paul George was quiet, scoring 11 on a poor 4 - 17 shooting night. Despite shooting 43 percent from three, the Pacers shot just 43 percent from the floor overall. Indiana will look to rebound Saturday night against the Jazz in Utah. Portland's next game comes on the road at Minnesota on Saturday.

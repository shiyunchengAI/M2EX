The Detroit Pistons defeated the Charlotte Hornets 114 - 108 Thursday in overtime at the Palace in Auburn Hills. The Hornets (24 - 33) actually held the lead for majority of Thursday's contest, as they entered halftime with a 12 - point lead and the fourth quarter with a 15 - point lead. But a big run from the Pistons (28 - 30) in the final period, which included some great back - and - forth between Kemba Walker and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in the closing moments, ultimately forced the game into overtime. From there, it was all Detroit as Caldwell-Pope carried them through the final five minutes. Caldwell-Pope hit seven three - pointers en route to scoring a game - high 33 points and grabbing nine rebounds in 43 minutes. Detroit also got yet another great performance off the bench from Tobias Harris, who scored 25 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting from the field in 37 minutes as a reserve. Walker did everything he could for the Hornets in the closing moments, matching every punch Caldwell-Pope threw at him and his team. He finished with a game - high 34 points, seven rebounds and six assists in 42 minutes, but unfortunately for Charlotte, it was n't enough. The loss results in the fifth straight loss for the Hornets and their 12th loss in their last 13 games. Every starter for Charlotte managed to score in double figures Thursday, but the team's bench unit continues to be a problem for this team, as the four players who saw minutes off the bench scored just 14 points on 6 - of - 21 shooting from the field. Up next, the Pistons will remain home Sunday to take on the Celtics, while the Hornets will look to end their losing streak Saturday against the Kings.

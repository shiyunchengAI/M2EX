The Dallas Mavericks (10) defeated the Phoenix Suns (0 - 1) 111 - 95 on Wednesday at Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix. The Mavericks got off to a quick start during their 2015 - 16 season opener, grabbing a nine - point lead by halftime. After out - scoring the Suns 34 - 21 in the third quarter as well, the Mavericks put the game out of reach and pushed on to their first victory of the season. As a team, the Mavericks went 47 percent from the field and an impressive 48 percent from the three - point line, while the Knicks finished at 39 percent from the field and just 25 percent from deep. With Chandler Parsons (knee) still out, the Mavericks moved Wesley Matthews over to small forward, which gave Raymond Felton the opportunity to enter the starting lineup at shooting guard. Felton made the most of his opportunity and torched the Suns for a game - high of 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), while also pitching in with six assists and four rebounds. Felton averaged just 4 points and 1 assists over 29 games with the Mavericks last season, so this was a fantastic performance for the guard. Deron Williams added 12 points (5 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt), six rebounds and an assist in his Mavericks' debut. He had to leave the game in the third quarter with a left knee contusion, though, so we'll have to wait and see if it forces him to miss any additional time. Dirk Nowitzki chipped in with 11 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt) and nine rebounds as well. The Suns' starting frontcourt trio of P.J. Tucker, Markieff Morris and Tyson Chandler really struggled in this one. They went a combined 3 - of - 11 from the field for just nine points, which clearly was the difference in this one. The backcourt combination of Brandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe was about all the Suns had going for them. Knight finished with 15 points (6 - 13 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), six rebounds and three assists, while Bledsoe added 13 points (4 - 12 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 5 - 7 FT), four rebounds and four assists. Knight did turn the ball over six times, which was a big factor in pushing the Suns to a whopping 18 turnovers as a team.The Suns' 13th overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, Devin Booker, shined in his professional debut, as he went 6 - for - 7 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line for 14 points over 21 minutes. The Mavericks next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, while the Suns will remain at home in a matchup against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday.

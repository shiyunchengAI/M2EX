The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Miami Heat, 93 - 90, at American Airlines Arena on Tuesday. Despite the victory, the Hawks (8 - 2) did not get off to the best start against a depleted Heat (2 - 8) squad. Atlanta struggled to get a lead over Miami and did n't pull ahead until there was just over two minutes left in the second period. From there, it was a game of runs as the teams traded leads before the Hawks were able to hold off one last push of desperation by Miami. Atlanta did, however, lose Dwight Howard late in the third quarter, as he left the game with a left quad contusion and did not return. He did still manage to finish with a double - double of 11 points and 11 rebounds in just 25 minutes. In the end, Dennis Schroder led the way for Atlanta, scoring 18 points and dishing out four assists, while Paul Millsap, who ended up playing a solid dose of minutes at the center position, posted 15 points, six rebounds, four assists and two steals Tuesday night. For the Heat, it was yet another dominant performance from center Hassan Whiteside, who finished with 19 points and 25 rebounds en route to his ninth double - double of the season. Josh Richardson matched Whiteside's 19 points in 38 minutes, as he looks to be fully healthy after missing the start of the season with a knee injury. Dion Waiters, however, who is filling in as the team's starting point guard with Goran Dragic (ankle) out, struggled from the field, shooting 5 - of - 18 and scoring just 11 points. Justise Winslow also missed Tuesday's game with a wrist injury. Up next, the Hawks will look to keep rolling at home against Milwaukee on Wednesday, while the Heat will look to turn things around against the Bucks on Thursday.

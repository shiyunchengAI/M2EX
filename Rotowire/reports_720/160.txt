The Knicks have been a different team this season and dominating wins like this show their improvement. Orlando had a one - point lead early in the first quarter, but that marked their only lead of the game. Three-point shooting really killed the Magic, as they went 5 - of - 27, while the Knicks went 9 - of - 20 from long range. Serge Ibaka was Orlando's best player, as he tallied 23 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double - double. Evan Fournier was n't far behind, as he accrued 21 points, five rebounds and four assists. Nikola Vucevic, Elfrid Payton and Jeff Green came off the bench to score 10 points a piece for Orlando. The Knicks bench outmatched that though, as they got 12 assists from Brandon Jennings and a monster 14 - point, 16 - rebound double - double from Kyle O'Quinn. Derrick Rose led the Knicks starters in scoring, as he dropped 19 points, five rebounds and three assists.

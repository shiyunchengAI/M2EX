James Harden scored 37 points on a ridiculous 18 - of - 18 from the free - throw line in the Rockets' win over the Celtics Monday. Amidst MVP chants from his home crowd, the league's fourth - leading scorer dropped 37 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. That was n't to say Harden was n't bothered by Boston's tough defense, however. Harden had 10 turnovers on the night, exceeding his assist total and putting him ahead of Russell Westbrook for the highest average in the league. Sixth man Eric Gordon, who left the game late with what appeared to be an ankle sprain, scored 19 points and made four three - pointers. As a whole, Houston hit 12 threes, continuing their dominance from beyond the arc. For Boston, a nagging injury appeared to hobble All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas, who shot just 7 - of - 18 from the field. Center Al Horford led the team with 21 points to go along with six rebounds and nine assists. Guard Avery Bradley had 16 points and a team - high 10 rebounds, but had his first game of the season without a three - pointer made.

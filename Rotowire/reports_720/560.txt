Charlotte's Nicolas Batum has spent his career stuffing the stat sheet, a talent he showed off on Monday. The guard led the team in both rebounding and assists, with 15 and seven respectively. Things were not perfect, however, for Batum, who went 0 - for - 6 from beyond the arc. Charlotte struggled from three - point range as a team, knocking down just three threes on the night. Guard Marco Belinelli accounted for two of those threes, as he scored 16 off the bench. For Dallas, meanwhile, forward Harrison Barnes led the way with 29 points and seven rebounds. Barnes shot a respectable 10 - of - 21 from the field and hit 2 - of - 4 from beyond the arc. Point guard Deron Williams, meanwhile, had an impressive double - double for Dallas, scoring 15 and dishing out 13 assists. However, Williams shot just 6 - of - 18 in the game.

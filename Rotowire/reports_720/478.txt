The Milwaukee Bucks (7 - 5) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (4 - 7) 122 - 118 in a triple - overtime thriller in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center. For the Bucks, the young core of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker helped lead the team to victory. Jabari Parker had a career - high 23 points (8 - 13 FG, 7 - 10 FT) as he was able to consistently score against the aging Nets defense. Meanwhile, Antetokounmpo continues his solid play with 18 points (7 - 11 FG, 4 - 8 FT) and 12 rebounds. Off the bench, Ersan Ilyasova thrived against the Nets as he had a solid 14 point performance (7 - 12 FG). Despite the Nets hard - fought defeat, Brook Lopez was an absolute monster against the Bucks interior defense, as he had an efficient 26 point (11 - 19 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and seven rebound performance, that included some key offensive boards in the later stages of the game. The back - court duo of Deron Williams (7 - 14 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt) and Bojan Bogdanovic (7 - 16 FG, 4 - 11 3Pt) combined to score 37 points, as they helped keep the team close for the entire game.

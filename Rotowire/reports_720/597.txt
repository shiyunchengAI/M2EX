The Dallas Mavericks (16 - 6) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (11 - 11) 125 - 102 on Sunday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The Mavericks used their superior shooting in this matchup, as they went 58 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three - point line. The Bucks in comparison shot 50 percent from the floor and only 27 percent from beyond the arc. The Mavericks also forced the Bucks into 19 turnovers, which only added to Dallas' advantage in the 23 - point victory. The trio of Chandler Parsons, Dirk Nowitzki and Monta Ellis really killed the Bucks. Parsons could n't miss and went 11 - for - 14 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 28 points. He's averaged just under 15 points up to this point, so it was a nice surprise for the Mavericks to get the type of production they've been looking for all season from him. Nowitzki shot nearly as well as Parsons and finished with 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and four rebounds. He struggled to only 10 points (2 - 10 FG) on Friday against the Suns, so it was a nice bounce back game for him. Ellis had 19 points (7 - 13 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and four assists as the third member of the starting lineup to reach double figures. In only five minutes off the bench, Richard Jefferson was able to go a perfect 4 - 4 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from beyond the arc to score 10 points. It was good enough to lead the bench in scoring. The Bucks had all five starters reach double figures in points, but just did n't play enough defense to keep them close. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the team with 18 points (8 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT) and four rebounds. It was the most points he's had in the last seven games, so the Bucks will hope it can boost his confidence even more. Brandon Knight had 16 points of his own, but did most of his damage from the free throw line where he went a perfect 7 - for - 7. He's done most of the scoring for the Bucks in the last two weeks, and it looks like it may continue. Rookie Jabari Parker shot 7 - for - 12 from the field to score 15 points, while also chipping in five rebounds. He's now averaging 12 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Zaza Puchulia gave a good push off the bench and fnished with 13 points and eight rebounds. The Mavericks' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday, while the Bucks will travel to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Tuesday.

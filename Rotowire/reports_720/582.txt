Cleveland's Big Three of Kyrie Irving, LeBron James and Kevin Love stepped up their collective game in the wake of the Cavs' three - game losing streak, combining for 86 of the team's 116 points. James led the way with 34 points, Love posted a 28 - point, 14 - rebound double - double and Irving supplied a 24 - point tally. The Cavs shot 48 and 44 percent from the field and three - point range, respectively. The dynamic duo of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan stepped up in their own right, with the latter's 31 points pacing the Raptors offense. Lowry managed a near double - double with 24 points and nine assists, while Jonas Valanciunas contributed 10 rebounds. DeMarre Carroll and Pascal Siakam totaled a modest 14 points, but Terrence Ross' and Patrick Patterson's combined 26 points off the bench helped make up for the scoring void.

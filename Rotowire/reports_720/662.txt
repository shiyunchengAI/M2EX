The New York Knicks (17 - 64) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (60 - 21) 112 - 108 on Monday at Philips Arena in Atlanta. While the Knicks have already been eliminated from the playoffs, this game did carry some weight in regards to their 2015 NBA Draft lottery odds. The Timberwolves now have taken over as the worst record in the league, so they'll likely end up with the highest odds come draft day in June for that number one overall pick. The Hawks, on the other hand, were n't affected much by the loss, as they've already locked up the number one overall seed for the playoffs in the Eastern Conference. It still has n't been determined who they'll play yet, but it should be either the Boston Celtics, Indiana Pacers, Brooklyn Nets or Miami Heat. The Knicks were the superior shooters in this game, going 56 percent from the field and 52 percent from the three - point line, while the Hawks finished at 44 percent from the floor and just 34 percent from deep. The Knicks turned the ball over 18 times compared to just eight from the Hawks, but they were able to overcome the disparity with their strong shooting. Langston Galloway had an extremely impressive performance. He went 10 - for - 12 from the field and a perfect 6 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points, while adding five rebounds and six assists as well. It was a complete turn around from Saturday's game against the Magic where he shot just 25 percent (4 - 16 FG) from the field, so the Knicks were happy to see the guard play so well with the season coming to an end. Tim Hardaway Jr. also had a very strong showing, finishing with 23 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) and five assists over 36 minutes. It was just the seventh time this season that he's reached the 20 - point mark, as he's averaging just 11 points on the season. Jason Smith had a big game with 20 points (7 - 13 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT), nine rebounds and five assists over 36 minutes as well. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver did their best to pull out this win for the Hawks. Teague finished with 19 points (7 - 17 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), nine assists and two steals, while Korver posted 19 points (4 - 10 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT) and five rebounds. Korver has been hitting three - pointers at a very high rate as the season has been winding down. He's made at least three three - pointers in six of his last seven games, which bodes well for the Hawks as the playoffs begin Saturday. With Paul Millsap getting the night off in hopes of having his shoulder return closer to 100 percent, both Al Horford and DeMarre Carroll put up some points in the frontcourt. Carroll finished with 16 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and four rebounds over 33 minutes, while Horford added 18 points (9 - 17 FG) and six rebounds over 33 minutes. While the Hawks' starters all played well, they just happened to run into the Knicks at the wrong time, as the Knicks played one of their best offensive games of the season. The Knicks' final game of the season will be at home against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, while the Hawks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Wednesday.

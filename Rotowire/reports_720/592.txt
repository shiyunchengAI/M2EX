The Toronto Raptors rallied back to defeat the visiting Utah Jazz 101 - 93, at Air Canada Center on Thursday evening. The Jazz started out strong, with a 27 - 18 first quarter, but were outscored in each of the remaining quarters, resulting in their second straight loss. Kyle Lowry scored 16 points in the fourth quarter alone, to fuel the final run that the Raptors needed to pull off an impressive home win. This was the first game back home after a six - game road trip for the Raptors (24 - 11). Despite shooting only 40 percent from the field, the Raptors scratched and clawed, with 10 steals, 27 points off turnovers and 12 fast break points, to pull off what seemed like an unlikely win. Kyle Lowry was the high - point man, with 33, along with six rebounds, five assists and three steals, in 41 minutes. DeMar DeRozan followed up with 23 points, seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block, in 37 minutes. Jonas Valanciunas had his best game in a while, as he tallied 18 points and 13 rebounds, in 31 minutes. The Raptors improve to 12 - 5 at home, but will have to turn right around and head back out on the road, as they play Saturday evening in Chicago. This marks the second straight loss for the Jazz (22 - 15), as they are now 1 - 2 on their current five - game road trip. They played a solid game and even led 75 - 71 at the beginning of the fourth. However, they were not able to keep up with Toronto's hustle in the final quarter, where they were outscored by 10. Only three players scored in double digits for the Jazz, led by Shelvin Mack, with 17. Rudy Gobert totaled 15 points and 16 rebounds, while Gordon Hayward added 16 points. The Jazz shot 46 percent from the field and 35 percent from long range, but were outscored at the free throw line and in the paint. The Jazz are now 10 - 8 on the road and have dropped two straight, while they move on to face the Timberwolves in Minnesota on Saturday.

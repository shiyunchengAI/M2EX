The Portland Trail Blazers (19 - 6) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (17 - 8) 108 - 95 on Monday. Portland has won two straight games, taking Monday's win on the back of LaMarcus Aldridge's double - double of 23 points and 14 rebounds. Damian Lillard also recorded a double - double of 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Starting center Robin Lopez suffered a broken hand in the game and is expected to be sidelined for a considerable amount of time. San Antonio has lost three of their last five, and surprisingly, the team continues to rest several of their key players despite losing games. Tim Duncan, Tiago Splitter and Manu Ginobili all sat out for rest, while Tony Parker missed the game with his lingering hamstring injury. Kawhi Leonard scored a team - high 21 points, and six total players finished in double figures for the Spurs. Portland will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday. The Spurs will host the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.

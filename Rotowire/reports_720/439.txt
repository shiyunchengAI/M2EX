The Los Angeles Clippers (22 - 13) throttled the Philadelphia 76ers (3 - 33) 130 - 99 on Saturday night to extend their season - long winning streak. This looked like a mismatch on paper and that proved to be the case on the court. The Clippers scored at least 27 points in every quarter and took a 29 - point lead into the fourth. They shot an incredible 61 percent from the field in the win and had far too many easy buckets. The starters were also a huge difference, as the Los Angeles starters amassed 72 points while the Sixers starters could only muster up 34 points. Philadelphia came into this game as huge underdogs in the second half of a back - to - back and it was clear they didn’t have it tonight. If that doesn’t make it hard enough, their 3 - 33 record does. They have been playing much more competitive lately, but this game was just one of those road blowouts that has become all too common with this team. Ish Smith led the team with 10 assists and Jahlil Okafor had a nice game off the bench. Okafor tallied 23 points and four rebounds in just 18 minutes of action. The Sixers will take on a fellow lottery contender on Monday when they play the Minnesota Timberwolves in their next game. The Clippers set a season - high tonight with their sixth - straight win and did it in dominating fashion. The starters were actually allowed to sit the final quarter and they could have had monster games if they got a full complement of minutes. Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan were still able to record double - doubles in just three quarters. Paul totaled 15 points and 14 assists, while Jordan provided 22 points and 13 rebounds. Austin Rivers scored a team - high 26 points, with most of that coming in garbage time It's strange to see this team finally clicking after the injury to Blake Griffin, but they ca n't be any worse when he returns in a few weeks. The Clippers will have some time off until they play the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday in their next game.

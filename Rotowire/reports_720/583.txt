The Boston Celtics (20 - 19) held on through a tight fourth quarter to earn a home win over the Indiana Pacers (22 - 17) Wednesday night at TD Garden, 103 - 94. The final period featured three ties and three lead changes as the two teams remained within four points of each other until Boston took a 99 - 94 lead on an Isaiah Thomas layup with 31 seconds remaining. The Celtics scored the game's final 12 points to foil a Pacers comeback attempt. Thomas scored a game - high 28 points behind a sharp 4 - 6 three - point shooting night, and he added four rebounds and three assists. Jae Crowder poured in 25 on a ruthlessly efficient 11 - 15 shooting night as he added three three - pointers of his own. The Celtics were spreading the ball around, as they recorded assists on 24 of their 40 made baskets and had four players with at least three dimes. Paul George led the Pacers with 23 points, but he shot a poor 7 - 20 from the floor and turned the ball over five times. Ian Mahinmi mustered a double - double with 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Pacers just could n't overcome their poor shooting, though, as they shot a brutal 5 - 30 from the three - point line (17 percent), including an 0 - 9 night from C.J. Miles. The Pacers have lost two of three and will look to turn it around Friday at home against Washington. Boston snapped a four - game losing streak and will continue a homestand against the Suns.

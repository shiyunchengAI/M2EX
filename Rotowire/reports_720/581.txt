The Charlotte Hornets (14 - 24) beat the Toronto Raptors (24 - 11) in Toronto on Thursday, 103 - 95. Toronto dropped just its fourth home game of the season and have now dropped four straight overall. The Hornets started the second half with a 14 - 1 run to gain an 11 - point lead mid way through the third quarter. Charlotte had big contributions from Gerald Henderson and Kemba Walker, who combined for 60 points in the contest. Charlotte entered the game without Cody Zeller, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Marvin Williams filled in for Zeller and had a productive night, scoring 13 points (5 - 10 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt) to go along with nine rebounds. The Hornets combined to shoot 48% from the floor and outscored the Raptors in the paint despite missing Zeller. Kemba Walker just missed out on his fourth consecutive 30 - point game, scoring 29 against the Raptors. Charlotte has now won four in a row and will take on the New York at Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Toronto has hit a rough patch and has now fallen to third place in the Eastern Conference behind the surging Hawks and Bulls. Kyle Lowry led the team in scoring with 24 points, but did so on just 7 - of - 22 shooting from the field. The Raptors will look to snap their losing streak on Saturday when they host the Celtics.

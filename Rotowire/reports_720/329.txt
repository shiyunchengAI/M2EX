The recent form of these teams would indicate an easy Atlanta win and that was just the case. In fact, the Hawks pulled out a wire - to - wire victory, as they held a double - digit lead for the final 30 - plus minutes. Defense was key, as they held Brooklyn to 40 percent shooting, while forcing 17 turnovers. Much of that was attributed to the 11 steals and 12 blocks the Hawks recorded. Dennis Schroder led Atlanta, tallying 20 points and 10 assists. Dwight Howard played just 27 minutes, but totaled 14 points and 16 rebounds. Paul Millsap provided 14 points, eight rebounds, four assists and three blocks. Brook Lopez led the Nets in scoring, as he dropped 20 points in an otherwise empty stat line. Bojan Bogdanovic was Brooklyn's best player, accruing 16 points, six rebounds and four assists.

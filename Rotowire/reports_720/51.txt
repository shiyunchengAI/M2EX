In a battle of squads missing key players, the Washington Wizards (4 - 4) topped the Orlando Magic (5 - 6) 108 - 99. Washington was without breakout shooting guard Bradley Beal (shoulder), leaving a void in the starting lineup to be filled by Garrett Temple. The absence of Beal's outside shooting was more than made up for, however, as the Wizards shot 43 percent from beyond the arc, including five made three - pointers from power forward Kris Humphries. Third-year forward Otto Porter Jr. also shone for the Wizards, recording four steals and finishing a team - high plus - 20 on the night. Orlando was also missing their starting shooting guard, as third - year star Victor Oladipo sat the contest out with a concussion. With a hole left at shooting guard, 23 - year - old Evan Fournier picked up the slack, recording a team - high 37 minutes and tallying 18 points. Center Nikola Vucevic was also able to exploit the thin Washington frontcourt, recording a 19 - point, 13 - rebound double - double. With the win, the Wizards improve their record to 4 - 4. They will hope to rise above .500 as they take on the Bucks on Tuesday in Washington. The Magic, meanwhile, will look to even out the win and loss columns at home on Wednesday against the Timberwolves.

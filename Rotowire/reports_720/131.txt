The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, 121 - 120, Monday night at Staples Center. In a game of runs, the game came down to who could make their free throws in the closing moments, with the Clippers (18 - 7) converting on just enough of their free throw attempts to hold off the Trail Blazers (12 - 14), who refused to go away, in the end. Fresh off his 20 - point, 20 - assist performance Saturday against the Pelicans, Chris Paul put together yet another impressive double - double, posting 21 points and 14 assists in 36 minutes. Blake Griffin led the way scoring for Los Angeles after missing the last game with knee soreness, posting 26 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. As a team, the Clippers were lethal from downtown, shooting 48 percent from long range. The Trail Blazers, however, were equally hot from behind the arc, shooting 48 percent themselves from three - point land. Regardless, they still fell a point short despite putting up an equally impressive performance overall. Their starting backcourt consisting of Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum combined to score 49 points, while starting center Mason Plumlee put together his best performance of the 2016 - 17 season, posting 18 points, seven rebounds, six assists and five blocks. Plumlee's performance put him in the same company as both Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo as the only three players to post such a stat line. Up next, the Clippers will head to Orlando Wednesday to take on the Magic, while the Trail Blazers will head home Tuesday and play the Thunder.

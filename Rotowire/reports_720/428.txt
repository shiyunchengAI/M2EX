The Milwaukee Bucks (2 - 3) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (0 - 4) by a score of 91 - 87 on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee Despite being the expected favorite coming in, the Bucks were n't able to get any sort of lead through the first three quarters, as time and again, the Sixers held strong. The Sixers eventually had an 85 - 82 lead with two and half minutes left in regulation, but the Bucks went on to outscore them 9 - 2 in the final two minutes to pull out the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. The Bucks were outrebounded 51 - 37 in this one, but forced the Sixers into 19 turnovers, which ended up making the difference. Struggling to get momentum this year, Khris Middleton finally turned things around Wednesday. Although he did n't have the best shooting percentage, he still led the team with 21 points (7 - 20 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), including a clutch three - pointer to put the Bucks up four points with less than 50 seconds in the game. Middleton was continually called upon for late - game heroics during the 2014 - 15 season, so Milwaukee was very happy to see the swingman return to form again Wednesday. Greg Monroe also was able to have success in this one, showing the young bigs of the Sixers his experience. Monroe finished with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 4 - 5 FT), eight rebounds, and three steals over 36 minutes. He's now combined for an impressive 41 points and 21 rebounds over his last two outings. Giannis Antetokounmpo chipped in with an efficient 17 points (7 - 11 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) and five rebounds of his own. Despite struggling to limit Monroe defensively, rookie Jahlil Okafor and second - year pro Nerlens Noel performed admirably on the offensive side of the ball. Okafor recorded 21 points (9 - 13 FG, 3 - 3 FT), six rebounds, and two blocked shots, while Noel finished with 17 points (8 - 16 FG, 1 - 2 FT), 12 rebounds, and one blocked shot. Noel has now notched three double - doubles over the first four games of the season, pushing his season averages to 12 points and 10 rebounds. Nik Stauskas was the only other Sixer in double figures with 14 points, but went a dreadful 3 - of - 14 from behind the three - point line. The Sixers will next head to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Friday, while the Bucks will be on the road against the New York Knicks on Friday.

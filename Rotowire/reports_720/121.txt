The Boston Celtics defeated the Charlotte Hornets, 104 - 98, at Spectrum Center on Saturday. Avery Bradley has long been renowned for his stingy defense and known as more of a complementary presence on the offensive side. It was vastly different story Saturday, however, as the veteran guard exploded for 31 points and a career - high 11 rebounds. The scoring total largely consisted of a personal - best eight three - pointers, and he and backcourt mate Isaiah Thomas combined for over half of Boston's points on the night. They also helped the Celtics (2 - 1) tally a 48 percent success rate from the field, including a 48 percent figure from beyond the arc, with the latter number nearly doubling the Hornets' (2 - 1) number. Bradley added four assists and a steal to his stellar stat line. Thomas contributed 24 points and added seven assists and a rebound. Al Horford supplied 14 points, four boards, three assists, two blocks and a steal, while Jae Crowder's full stat line included nine points, nine rebounds, four assists, three blocks and two steals. Kemba Walker once again served as the linchpin of the Charlotte attack, which has been decidedly top - heavy so far this season. He posted 29 points, three assists, two rebounds and three steals. Nicolas Batum had his hands full all night on defense with Bradley and totaled a modest 12 points of his own, along with six assists, four rebounds and a pair of blocks. No other starter managed double - digit scoring, although Cody Zeller, starting at center, did haul in nine rebounds. Frank Kaminsky III paced the bench with 11 points. The Celtics head back home to take on the Bulls on Wednesday, while the Hornets face off with the Sixers in a home tilt Wednesday as well.

The recent form of these teams would indicate a Miami blowout, but Orlando had other ideas. In fact, they led for well over 40 minutes of this game, as they never looked in jeopardy to relinquish the lead. Rebounding was the key, with the Magic winning that battle, 52 - 37. Three-point shooting was a huge factor as well, with Orlando hitting 57 percent from long distance to Miami's 27 percent. Evan Fouriner carried the Magic, as he tallied 24 points and four assists. Nikola Vucevic recorded a double - double, toting 13 points, 17 rebounds and three steals. Elfrid Payton was huge off the bench, providing 20 points, five rebounds and four assists. Dion Waiters led the way for Miami, as he amassed 23 points and six assists. Hassan Whiteside accumulated 12 points, 19 rebounds, two blocks and two steals. Goran Dragic scored 22 points in an otherwise empty stat line.

The Golden State Warriors (29 - 1) defeated the Sacramento Kings (12 - 19) 122 - 103 on Monday. A wild and event filled night went down at Oracle Arena, as Stephen Curry went lights out for a three minute span that included 17 points in the last three minutes of the first half. DeMarcus Cousins highlighted the second half of play, and was ejected after arguing his fifth foul of the night, leading to a technical foul call followed by an early exit. Curry’s night did not start until the end of the first half, but he continued the hot shooting trend in the 3rd quarter, and finished with his first triple - double of the season, going for 23 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists. Klay Thompson poured in 29 points and Draymond Green added 25 points of his own, as the Warriors big three contributed over 60 percent of the team's points. At this point of the season, we have grown accustomed to the Warriors impressive 3 - point shooting, and tonight was no different, as Golden State shot 48 percent from deep as a unit. While the loss of Cousins dealt a major blow to the Kings’ chances in the second half, they did play competitively in the first half and through Curry’s hot streak. Omri Casspi went for a career high 36 points, including Curry like 3 - pointers from 32 - plus feet, and finished 9 - of - 12 from deep. Casspi’s impressive night was the spark Sacramento needed to compete without their all star center. Rajon Rondo got into foul trouble early, picking up three in the first quarter and played a total of 17 minutes. Rondo finished with four points and two assists, far below his season averages. Rudy Gay contributed 17 points, while Darren Collison did his best to aid the bench, adding 13 points, 11 assists and six rebounds. The Kings will look to bounce back when they host the Philadelphia 76ers (2 - 31) on Wednesday, while the Warriors will also play on Wednesday, and take their five game winning streak to the Dallas Mavericks (18 - 13).

The Los Angeles Lakers (14 - 41) defeated the Boston Celtics (20 - 33) 118 - 111 in overtime on Sunday. Los Angeles took the win to tie the season series with Boston 1 - 1. The win also helped end the Lakers' seven - game losing streak that stretched back to Feb. 1. Jeremy Lin was the catalyst Sunday, finishing with a team - high 25 points in 30 minutes off the bench. Four bench players finished with double - digit points, as coach Byron Scott turned to his reserves to lead the way. The Celtics have dropped two straight, but they did enjoy a nice debut performance from Isaiah Thomas. He finished with 21 points in 25 minutes off the bench before getting ejected for arguing an offensive foul call made against him with five minutes left in the fourth quarter. Jae Crowder lead the rally back in the fourth to push the game to overtime, but it was Avery Bradley who hit a three - pointer as time expired to send the game into the extra period. Lin was a part of every scoring play in overtime, dishing out three assists in the additional five minutes and scoring four points. Los Angeles will travel to Utah to play the Jazz on Wednesday, and the Celtics will wrap up their road trip in Phoenix on Monday.

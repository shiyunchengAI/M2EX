The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Center on Monday. Paul MIllsap was the hero for Atlanta, as he drained a floating layup with 0:1 remaining in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime, and then assisted Kent Bazemore on game winning jumper in the extra time. Millsap went on to put the game out of reach the free throw line and secure the road victory for Atlanta (32 - 23). The Blazers (23 - 32) dropped to 14 - 13 on their home court, but were hanging tough with the Hawks throughout the contest. Damian Lillard was flexing his range from way beyond 24 - feet, while C.J. McCollum was clutch with needed baskets down the stretch. The duo combined for 47 points, but it took 45 shots, and outside of the strong shooting in the fourth quarter, Lillard ended up going 6 - of - 21 from the field. Millsap was far from efficient in his effort as well, but his play when it mattered most shined through on his way to 21 points, nine rebound, five assists, two steals and four blocks on 4 - of - 12 shooting. Tim Hardaway Jr. punched in 25 points across 43 minutes, and has really been phenomenal in his starts for Thabo Sefolosha. Hardaway added seven rebounds, four assists and one steal. Dwight Howard was monsterous on the boards, and ended up with 19 points and 16 rebounds. Next up, the Hawks will visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, while the Blazers play the same night on the road at the Utah Jazz.

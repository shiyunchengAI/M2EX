When the worst offense faces the worst defense, 29 - point games are the outcome. Golden State were unstoppable on offense, as they sjhot 63 percent from the field and 67 percent from three - point range. Much of that has to be attributed to ball movement, as they recorded 37 assists on 49 buckets. Eric Bledsoe did all he could to keep the Suns hanging around, as he accumulated 27 points, five rebounds, four assists and five steals in the defeat. The Splash Brothers (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson) were on display for Golden State, as they combined for 57 points, going 11 - of - 14 from three - point range. Kevin Durant was n't too shabby either, totaling 20 points, four rebounds and eight assists. Draymond Green's nine points and five rebounds do n't look great, but he handed out a game - high 13 assists, making numerous hustle plays with the game well out of hand.

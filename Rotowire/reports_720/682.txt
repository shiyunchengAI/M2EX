The grit - and - grind Memphis Grizzlies (44 - 17) took home the 97 - 90 win over the Los Angeles Lakers (16 - 45) on Friday. The Grizzlies are 5 - 3 since returning from the All-Star break, doing enough to stay nestled between the Western Conference-leading Golden State Warriors and the third - place Portland Trial Blazers for second place in West playoff standings. Zach Randolph led the way with a team - high 24 points and 13 rebounds in 37 minutes to help the Grizzlies put a bowtie on their season series with the Lakers, having won all four matchups. Rookie point guard Jordan Clarkson scored a career - high 25 points, but after he made a two - point field goal to put the Lakers up 75 - 67 with 11 minutes left in the game, Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger put Tony Allen on the rookie, and the Grizzlies roared back, with Clarkson bottled up so bad that he only got off two more shots the rest of the way and missed both of them. Still trailing 87 - 86 with 1:50 left in the game, Jeff Green stole the ball on a bad pass from Jordan Hill, and Green ended up being fouled, which sent him to the line to knock down both of his free throws and give the Grizzlies the lead they would never relinquish. Memphis will travel to New Orleans to play the Pelicans on Saturday, and the Lakers will return home to host the Mavericks on Sunday, when they will try to stop their four - game skid.

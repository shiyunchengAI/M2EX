The Charlotte Hornets defeated the Orlando Magic, 109 - 88, at Spectrum Center on Friday. While the Magic (10 - 14) has generally played tough defense this season, their efforts on that side of the ball have often been undermined by a lack of offensive proficiency. The most recent example was Friday, when Orlando was only able to post 37 percent and 27 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. Meanwhile, the backcourt duo of Kemba Walker and Nicolas Batum combined for 31 points on 13 - of - 24 shooting to spearhead a 48 percent tally for the Hornets (14 - 9), who pulled away with a 39 - point third quarter. Orlando was led by a modest 14 points from Evan Fournier, who added two rebounds. Serge Ibaka followed with 12 points, seven boards, three assists and a block. Aaron Gordon and Bismack Biyombo supplied a pair of nine - point efforts, while D.J. Augustin managed just eight points, two rebounds, an assist and two steals in 19 minutes despite drawing the start. Matching 16 - point totals from Nicolas Batum and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist paced the Hornets, with the former adding nine boards and seven assists, and the latter hauling in seven boards and dishing out an assist. Walker was close behind with 15 points, five assists and a steal. Cody Zeller registered nine points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal, while the bench was led by a pair of 12 - point efforts from Jeremy Lamb and Ramon Sessions. The Magic head back home to face the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night, while the Hornets head to Cleveland for a Saturday night showdown against the Cavaliers.

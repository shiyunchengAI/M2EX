The Boston Celtics (20 - 31) made an unbelievable comeback to defeat the top - seeded Atlanta Hawks (43 - 10) 89 - 88 on Wednesday at the TD Garden. When Atlanta's Mike Scott jammed an alley oop home to put the Hawks up 79 - 65 in the fourth, it looked like this was going to be another easy win for the top team in the East. However, the Celtics made an unbelievable push to storm back. Boston called on Evan Turner on inbounds play with six seconds left and Turner hit a floater to give the Celtics the lead with under a second remaining. Atlanta seemed poised to enter the All-Star break on a two game winning streak, but was unable to close out Boston. Every starter except for Al Horford had poor nights shooting, highlighted by Jeff Teague's 4 - for - 12 performance and Paul Millsap's 3 - for - 11 outing. The Hawks have a tough stretch awaiting on the other side of the break with the Raptors, Bucks, and Mavericks on the slate. Boston was able to overcome a 32 percent shooting performance on the night as the Celtics got several great fourth quarter showings. Jared Sullinger shook off a rough first half to finish the night with 17 points and 15 rebounds. Avery Bradley hit a three - pointer to bring Boston within one point with just under two minutes to go. The Celtics go into the break on a high note and will resume play with a three - game road swing starting in Sacramento on Feb. 20.

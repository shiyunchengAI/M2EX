The Milwaukee Bucks defeated the New York Knicks, 105 - 104, at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. The Knicks (16 - 19) checked in to Wednesday's contest looking to snap a five - game losing streak and heading into the fourth quarter, they looked like they were well on their way to that goal. New York led the Bucks (18 - 16) by a comfortable 87 - 73 margin, but a surging Milwaukee squad was n't done by any stretch. They ultimately outscored their hosts by a 32 - 17 spread in the final 12 minutes, capping off a momentous comeback with a 15 - foot bucket from Giannis Antetokounmpo as time expired to seal the somewhat improbable road win.

Jabari Parker contributed 15 points, four rebounds, three assists and a steal. Malcolm Brogdon went for 12 points, eight assists and six rebounds.

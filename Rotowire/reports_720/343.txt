The Philadelphia 76ers (12 - 40) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (22 - 28) 89 - 81 on Saturday at the Wells Fargo Center. Philadelphia won its fourth straight home game despite being without point guard Michael Carter-Williams, who was sidelined with a foot injury. The 76ers were down by six at the half, but outscored the Hornets 28 - 13 in the third quarter to gain the lead. Charlotte's Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went down with a hamstring injury and did not return. The Hornets were outscored by 17 after Kidd-Gilchrist left the contest. Charlotte notched two victories against Washington earlier in the week, but was unable to carry that momentum into Saturday's contest. Lance Stephenson had a tough night from the floor, going 3 - for - 11 on field goal attempts to finish with six points in 33 minutes on the floor. Charlotte has a slim one - game lead on Miami for the seventh spot in the East, with Brooklyn and Detroit also within striking distance. The Hornets have a quick turnaround as they will host the Pacers on Sunday. Philadelphia bounced back from a 107 - 96 loss in Boston on Friday to beat a Charlotte team that had won seven of its last ten games entering Saturday. Tim Frazier moved into the starting lineup and dished out eight assists in 37 minutes of play. Robert Covington had a game - high 22 points to go with eight rebounds and a block. On the injury front, Michael Carter-Williams will work with team trainers Sunday to test out his injured foot and is considered questionable for Philadelphia's next game, which is Monday against Golden State.

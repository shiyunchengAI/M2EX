The Golden State Warriors (16 - 2) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (8 - 9) 112 - 85 on Thursday. Golden State is on an 11 - game win streak that they've collected during a particularly easy part of their schedule. Stephen Curry continues to make his bid for the MVP Award, putting up his fifth double - double of the season. He scored 19 points and dished 11 assists in 31 minutes. Klay Thompson scored a team - high 23 points, and Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes finished with double - doubles of their own. They'll face a more seasoned opponent in the Chicago Bulls on the road Saturday, giving them a real pliability test as they try to add to their already impressive win streak. New Orleans has lost four of their last five games to fall below .500 for the first time since Nov. 4. Anthony Davis continues to do his best to keep the Pelicans poised for the playoff chase. He put up 30 points and 15 rebounds in 38 minutes, but the team shot just 42 percent from the field and 20 percent from beyond the three - point line. Despite an impressive top - six players on their roster, the Pelicans are woefully thin on the bench, and the absence of Eric Gordon (shoulder) has impacted their ability to win games more than it should, but coach Monty Williams has been unable to find a viable fill - in on his bench. Gordon is n't returning any time soon, and New Orleans is n't going to have it much easier Saturday when they continue their road trip in Los Angeles against the Clippers.

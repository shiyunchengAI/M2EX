The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 130 - 101, at AT & T Center on Saturday. The Nets (6 - 16) have shown perhaps a bit more than was expected of them, even factoring in an injury to key offseason acquisition Jeremy Lin. However, most of their successes have come at home, as they entered Saturday with a 1 - 8 road record. Their futility away from Barclays Center unsurprisingly continued against the stingy Spurs (19 - 5), who elicited 16 turnovers from the visitors and held them to 41 percent and 26 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. Kawhi Leonard also cut right through the heart of the Brooklyn defense, going for 30 points, six rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block. Brooklyn was led Bojan Bogdanovic's 20 points, which he supplemented with four rebounds and two assists. Brook Lopez was next with 14 points, five boards, five assists and a block. Trevor Booker contributed nine points, four rebounds and two assists, but Isaiah Whitehead and Sean Kilpatrick could only muster a combined 11 points. Luis Scola led the bench with a 15 - point contribution, while Joe Harris registered 10 points in a reserve role as well. Pau Gasol was second on the Spurs with 15 points, six rebounds, four assists and a block. LaMarcus Aldridge and Tony Parker contributed a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former also supplying nine rebounds, three assists and a block, and the latter compiling seven assists, a rebound and a steal. Patty Mills paced the second unit with 16 points over 16 minutes, while Jonathon Simmons was right behind him with 14 points. The Nets continue remain in the Lone Star State and face off with the Houston Rockets on Monday night, while the Spurs are off until Wednesday night, when the Boston Celtics come to town.

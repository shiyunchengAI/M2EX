In a matchup with major implications for the Eastern Conference playoffs, the surging Atlanta Hawks (44 - 30) took down the host Detroit Pistons (39 - 35) 112 - 95. Atlanta has now won eight of its last nine contests and holds a full game lead over the Boston Celtics for third in the Eastern Conference. The Hawks looked like the dominant team the league saw in 2014 - 15 in Detroit, as they were able to handily blow out a playoff contender. Atlanta recorded a whopping 34 team assists and even more impressively turned the ball over just four times as a unit. The absolutely unheard of ball security allowed Atlanta to control the game despite a 54 - 39 rebounding deficit. Players across the Hawks roster got involved, as all five starters and three bench players scored in double - digits. The near - perfect team play will likely bode well for Atlanta as the season comes to a close. Detroit, meanwhile, is left battling division rival Chicago for the last playoff spot in the East. The Pistons remain two games up on the spot, but have seven contests remaining before they are home free. All-Star Andre Drummond had a big 19 points and 17 rebounds on Saturday, but could n't do enough get the job done against the red - hot Hawks. The Pistons shot just 39 percent from the field, struggling to find their shot all night. Detroit will host the Thunder on Tuesday, whlie Atlanta will visit Chicago on Monday.

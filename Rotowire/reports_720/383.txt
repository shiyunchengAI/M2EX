The Houston Rockets (8 - 4) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (7 - 7) 113 - 100 in Game 7 of their second - round playoff series on Sunday in Houston and have won the series. The Rockets were in full control of the game from start to finish. The Clippers had their runs, closing the gap to as low as three points at one point in the third quarter, but they could never get over the hump and Houston had little trouble sealing the deal, closing out the series and advancing to the Western Conference Finals. Following the Game 6 victory where he didn’t play a single minute in the fourth quarter, James Harden had a masterful performance, scoring a game - high 31 points (7 - 20 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 15 - 18 FT) to go along with seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals in 43 minutes. Trevor Ariza was an absolute sharp shooter from behind the 3 - point line Sunday afternoon, shooting 6 - of - 12 from behind the arc and scoring 22 points along with seven rebounds in 43 minutes. Dwight Howard posted yet another double - double, totaling 16 points (6 - 8 FG, 4 - 8 FT) and 15 rebounds in 32 minutes; this third straight double - double and seventh in his last eight games. Mid-season acquisitions Josh Smith (15) and Corey Brewer (11) round out the five Rocket players who scored in double figures. The Clippers’ loss means the franchise still has yet to make a Western Conference Finals in their history, and the loss occurred at the hands of an epic collapse. Even though Chris Paul is the undisputed leader of the team, he is not to fault for the loss, as he played his heart out in the losing effort. Paul finished with 26 points (9 - 20 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt), five rebounds, 10 assists and four steals in 45 minutes. Blake Griffin led the team in scoring, recording 27 points (13 - 23 FG), 11 rebounds and six assists in 44 minutes. Griffin’s effort caps off an incredible playoff run where he posted averages of 25 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists over 40 minutes. DeAndre Jordan posted a double - double of his own, putting up 16 points and 17 rebounds, while Jamal Crawford (17) and J.J. Redick (10) round out the five Los Angeles players who scored in double figures. The Clippers could have used more out of Matt Barnes, who after playing solidily throughout the entire playoffs, was held scoreless in 22 minutes of play. With the win, Houston completed an incredible comeback after finding themselves down 3 - 1 in the series and have now earned the right to play in the Western Conference Finals. They will go up against the Golden State Warriors, who they played four times during the regular season and lost all four meetings.

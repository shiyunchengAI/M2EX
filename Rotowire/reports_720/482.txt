Death, taxes, and Russell Westbrook triple - doubles. The All-Star point guard recorded his 24th triple - double of the season against New Orleans, posting a line of 27 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists. Numbers like those have become commonplace for the superstar, who is on pace to become the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double in a season. Westbrook also looks poised to eclipse Wilt Chamberlain's record 41 triple - doubles in a season, a feat that many once considered unachievable. For the Thunder, big men Steven Adams and Enes Kanter made big impacts as well. Adams had 20 points, 11 rebounds, and four blocks, while Kanter had 17 points and 10 rebounds off the bench. The Thunder blocked 11 shots in total. New Orleans, meanwhile, saw just eight points and five rebounds in 16 minutes for Anthony Davis, who left the game with a quad contusion. The team was led by guard E'Twaun Moore, who delivered a stellar 18 points and eight rebounds off the bench.

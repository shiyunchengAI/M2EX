The Denver Nuggets (16 - 20) defeated the Orlando Magic (13 - 25) 93 - 90 on Wednesday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. The Nuggets were the better shooting team in this one, going 45 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line, while the Magic went 40 percent from the floor and 36 percent from beyond the arc. Along with the shooting advantage, the Nuggets also out - rebounded the Magic 47 - 42, helping them edge the Magic with a three point victory. As has been the case for the majority of the season, the Nuggets relied on their starting backcourt for their offensive production. Ty Lawson led the team with 23 points, as he was able to shoot 9 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line. After recording only eight points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, this performance was a nice bounce back game for him. Arron Afflalo had a solid contribution of his own, scoring 17 points (7 - 13 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT), while adding six rebounds and three assists. He's had the hot hand of late, as he's averaging 23 points over his last four games. The Nuggets also saw their bench chip in as Nate Robinson recorded 13 points (1 - 6 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt). While he really struggled with his shot from the field, he forced his way to the line all game, converting on a perfect 10 - of - 10 from the free throw line. J.J. Hickson recorded a double - double off the bench with 11 points (4 - 5 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and 10 rebounds as well. The Magic took advantage of Nuggets' starting center Jusuf Nurkic, who is in his rookie season and was forced into the starting lineup after Timofey Mozgov was traded to the Cavaliers. They fed the ball to Nikola Vucevic all night, who finished with 20 points (8 - 18 FG, 4 - 6 FT) and 11 rebounds in 34 minutes. It was his second 20 - point performance in a row, along with his second double - double in as many games. Victor Oladipo had a strong night offensively. He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 17 points, while also recording six assists. He also added three steals, after posting four on Sunday against the Charlotte Hornets. Coming off the bench, Evan Fournier stayed productive. He went 4 - for - 8 from the field and 2 - for - 5 from beyond the arc to score 14 points in 18 minutes. Tobias Harris did n't have the offensive numbers he's come accustomed to this year, as he finished with only 12 points (5 - 13 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT) and six rebounds. The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Sacramento Kings on Friday, while the Magic will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday.

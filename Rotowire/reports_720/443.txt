The Los Angeles Clippers (9 - 8) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (8 - 9) 107 - 99 on Sunday. The Clippers led by 11 at the half and it never got much closer than that. Los Angeles did a great job of keeping a six - to - eight point distance from the T'Wolves throughout the second half to hold them off for a much needed win. Both teams shot well in this matchup, as Minnesota shot 45 percent while Los Angeles shot 52 percent. The Clippers starters outscored the Wolves starters 80 - 58 and that proved to be the difference in the game. Minnesota was 6 - 2 on the road coming into this game, but were unable to add to that impressive record. Minnesota had six players score in double - digits, but the problem was that the other five players combined for just eight points, with three of them going scoreless. The T-Wolves were led by Andrew Wiggins once again who dropped 21 points. Zach LaVine also had a nice game filling - in for Ricky Rubio, as he tallied 18 points and seven assists in the defeat. Karl-Anthony Towns was having a very good game through three quarters, but he barely played in the fourth for an unknown reason. Minnesota will take on the Orlando Magic in their next fixture on Tuesday. The Clippers had lost eight of 11 games before their win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, so this added to that to start a modest two - game winning streak. Los Angeles got some much needed momentum here, as they are far too talented to be hovering around .500. They were extremely efficient today as a team, as they shot 52 percent and assisted 24 times on 39 baskets. The team was led by a near triple - double from Blake Griffin, who collected 26 points, eight rebounds and eight assists in the win. They also got 20 points and nine assists from Chris Paul and these two will need to play like this going forward if they want to dig out of this hole. They'll keep digging in a favorable matchup, when they host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.

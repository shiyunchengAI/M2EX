The Atlanta Hawks defeated the San Antonio Spurs, 114 - 112, in overtime at Phillips Arena on Sunday. Kawhi Leonard made his return for the Spurs (27 - 7) after a two - game absence due to a stomach virus, but the bigger story on the San Antonio side turned out to be LaMarcus Aldridge, who bounced back nicely from an eight - point performance against his former Trail Blazers teammates on Friday to score 27 points, along with 13 rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Meanwhile, on Atlanta's end, it was Tim Hardaway, Jr. who posted 29 points off the bench. His 26 - foot three - point jumper with three seconds remaining in regulation knotted the game at 100, and Leonard's missed 14 - foot shot as time expired insured a fifth quarter. Hardaway drained two more three - pointers early and a key free throw late in the extra period, and Leonard missed a driving layup at the buzzer, helping the Hawks (18 - 16) escape with a hard - fought win. Tony Parker tallied 22 points, six assists and three rebounds behind Aldridge. Pau Gasol had a near double - double with 18 points, nine boards, two assists, a steal and a block. Leonard had 13 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block. Manu Ginobili led the second unit with 10 points, three rebounds, three assists and two steals. Paul Millsap paced the Hawks with 32 points, 13 rebounds, three assists and a block. Hardaway supplemented his point total with five rebounds and an assist. Dennis Schroder followed with 16 points, 10 assists, two rebounds and a block. Kyle Korver posted 14 points, eight rebounds, four assists, a steal and a block in 39 minutes off the bench. Kent Bazemore, Thabo Sefolosha and Dwight Howard notably underwhelmed on the starting five, combining for just 17 points overall. The Spurs head back home to face the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday evening, while the Hawks head to Orlando for a Wednesday night date with the Magic.

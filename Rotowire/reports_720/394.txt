The Washington Wizards defeated the New York Knicks 103 - 100 Thursday at Madison Square Garden. Coming off maybe their most impressive win on the season, a road victory against the Celtics, the Knicks (19 - 25) had an opportunity to really step out of a funk and get on the right track at home. However, John Wall and the Wizards (23 - 19) ended up being too much for New York on their own home floor. Wall finished with a team - high 29 points, 13 assists, five rebounds and three steals in 37 minutes. Otto Porter Jr. continued his hot streak as well, posting 23 points and six rebounds while going a scorching - hot 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc. As a team, all things were clicking offensively from the Wizards, with the team as a whole shooting 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from three as they notched their fourth straight victory. As for the Knicks, it was a disappointing result, especially with the return of Kristaps Porzingis from an Achilles injury. The Latvian came off the bench to score 15 points in 29 minutes, but it was Carmelo Anthony that really kept the team in the team. Anthony finished with a game - high 34 points on 13 - of - 27 shooting on top of 10 rebounds, while Derrick Rose had his second straight solid game, as he finished with 20 points. In the end, however, it was New York's inability to hit an outside shot that ultimately led to their demise, as they made just seven of their 24 attempts from long range (29 percent). Up next, the Wizards will look for their fifth straight win against the Pistons on Saturday, while the Knicks will remain home Saturday to take on the Suns.

The Sacramento Kings (16 - 22) fell to the Dallas Mavericks (27 - 12) on Tuesday at the Sleep Train Arena 108 - 104. The Kings looked to be on their way to closing this game out late in the fourth quarter after surrendering just 10 points to the Mavericks through the first ten minutes of the period. However, thanks to some clutch throw shooting and an offensive foul from DeMarcus Cousins, Dallas was able to send this contest to overtime. Recently acquired Rajon Rondo drained the go - ahead three with just over a minute to go in the overtime period to give the Mavericks a lead they would not relinquish. Dallas snapped its two - game losing skid in a tight game that went down to the wire. Monta Ellis led the Mavericks in scoring with 28 points and he added 10 assists. The Mavericks have a quick turnaround as they will travel to Denver to take on the Nuggets on Wednesday. Sacramento had a chance to win consecutive games for the first time since late November, but came up short. The Kings were n't able to survive overtime without their best player, Cousins, who fouled out late in the fourth. Sacramento was also without Rudy Gay for most of the game after he suffered a sprained knee in the first quarter. He is considered day - to - day at this point. The Kings will have a couple of days off before hosting the Heat on Friday.

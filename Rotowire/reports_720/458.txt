The Minnesota Timberwolves (8 - 8) defeated the Sacramento Kings (6 - 11) 101 - 91 on Friday. In a tightly - contested game, the rebounding and free - throw shooting ended up being the difference. Minnesota outrebounded Sacramento 45 - 35 and made 95 percent of their free - throws, while the Kings made just 60 percent of theirs. These are two talented teams who prefer to play up - tempo, but that was n't the case here. With a projected total of 216, the 192 total was surprisingly low. Minnesota has been a strange team this year, as they continue to win on the road and lose at home. They are now 6 - 2 on the road and 2 - 6 at home. Usually a young team like this only plays well at home, but there's something unique about this roster. The Timberwolves were led by Andrew Wiggins once again, who tallied 22 points and six rebounds in the win. They played this game without Ricky Rubio, but Zach LaVine filled - in admirably. LaVine amassed 19 points, eight rebounds and four assists in the victory. The 8 - 8 start is a fantastic sign for this rebuilding team and the future is extremely bright with all of these talented youngsters. The Wolves will look to keep this going against the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. The Kings played this game without superstar DeMarcus Cousins and it clearly hampered them here. Rudy Gay is usually asked to step up in these circumstances, but he had one of the worst games of his career. In fact, Gay shot 1 - for - 13 from the field to accumulate two points and four rebounds. With a game like that and no Cousins in the lineup, it's nearly impossible for Sacramento to win. Sacramento did however get another spectacular game out of Rajon Rondo, who tallied 16 points, 16 assists and four rebounds in the loss. The Kings will need Boogie Cousins back for their next game if they want a chance, as they have to take on the undefeated Golden State Warriors on Saturday.

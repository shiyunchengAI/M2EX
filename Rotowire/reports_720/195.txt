The Atlanta Hawks (22 - 8) defeated the Milwaukee Bucks (15 - 16) 90 - 85 on Saturday. Playing on the second night of a home - and - home back - to - back between these two teams, the Hawks came into Saturday's game looking for revenge after they took a beating at the hands of the Bucks 107 - 77 on Friday, and they got their revenge. Atlanta jumped out to a 21 - 10 lead after the first quarter. They gave up most of their lead in the second quarter but had enough to hang on for the win. Jeff Teague paced the team with a game - high 25 points in 37 minutes, indicating that he is probably over his hamstring injury. The Hawks shot a putrid 37 percent from the field but were able to secure the win by holding the Bucks to an unremarkable 39 percent shooting from the field and by getting 32 easy points on 19 turnovers by the Bucks. Milwaukee was playing without Ersan Ilyasova (concussion) and Larry Sanders (illness), leaving them inadequately supplied to deal with the strength and skill of Al Horford and Paul Millsap. Khris Middleton found success off the bench, putting up a team - high 21 points in 37 minutes. The Bucks will continue their road trip against the Charlotte Hornets on Monday.

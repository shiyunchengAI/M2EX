The Washington Wizards (25 - 11) defeated the Chicago Bulls (25 - 12) 102 - 86 on Friday. Washington has won three straight games to help keep them in second place in the Eastern Conference standings, just below the first place Atlanta Hawks. Marcin Gortat led the way against Chicago with a double - double of 21 points and 13 rebounds, and both Nene Hilario and John Wall finished with double - doubles as well. After sitting out Wednesday's game to get some rest, Paul Pierce returned to action Friday and finished with seven points in 29 minutes. Chicago has dropped two straight, and they struggled on both sides of the court Friday. As a team, they shot just 39 percent from the field and 63 percent from the free - throw line. Derrick Rose scored a team - high 19 points to go with two assists, and Pau Gasol put up a double - double of 12 points and 13 rebounds. Mike Dunleavy (ankle) missed a fourth straight game and will undergo an MRI on Saturday. He has not been able to run, yet, making him questionable in the short term. The Wizards will go on the road to face the Hawks on Sunday, and the Bulls will return home to host the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday.

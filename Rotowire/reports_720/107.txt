The host Portland Trail Blazers took down the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday, 115 - 98. Portland (22 - 28) is now 4 - 1 in its last five games. After a tough month of December, the Blazers have come back into form, with their only loss in the past two weeks coming by two points to the Golden State Warriors. On Tuesday, Portland blew out the struggling Hornets on the backs of strong play from its guards and wings. Star point guard Damian Lillard led the team with 27, while sixth man Allen Crabbe delivered 21 points off the bench. Portland led tentatively in the first half but pulled away entirely thanks to a strong third quarter. The Blazers surprisingly excelled on the boards on Tuesday, an area where the team has seen little success all season. Portland held a 51 - 42 advantage in the rebounding column. Charlotte (23 - 26) has now lost five games in a row and is not in the position it hoped to be early in the season. The Hornets have seen one of the season's more catastrophic slides, falling from a contender at the top of the East to a team battling for the eighth seed. On Tuesday, All-Star point guard Kemba Walker dropped in 22 points to lead the team, but it was to no avail. The Hornets shot a dismal 39 percent from the field as a unit and struggled in most areas, including perimeter defense and rebounding. The Hornets will visit Golden State on Wednesday, while Portland will play host to the Mavericks on Friday.

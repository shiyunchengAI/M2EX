The Cleveland Cavaliers (50 - 20) defeated the Denver Nuggets (29 - 42) 124 - 91 on Monday. Even without Kevin Love (illness), the Cavs had no trouble exerting their will on a considerably inferior Nuggets squad, and clinching a division title in the process. LeBron James had been fairly quiet in recent games by his standards, but stepped up his role in the offense without Love in the lineup. LeBron managed his second triple - double of the season, posting 33 points, eleven rebounds and eleven assists. Cleveland outperformed Denver in every major category, and played an outstanding defensive game overall. They also managed a 56 percent success rate from the field, and a 48 percent figure from three - point range. The Nuggets were paced by a spectacular effort off the bench from Will Barton, who managed 27 points, four rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris led the starters, but it was only with a pair of 11 - point efforts. The former also added four rebounds, three assists and three steals, while the latter managed a pair of rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals. No other member of the first unit tallied double - digit points, but Jusuf Nurkic did pitch in with 11 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and three blocks in 26 minutes off the bench. Denver remains in fourth place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division, and 7 games behind eighth - seeded Dallas Mavericks. They're home against the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday. J.R. Smith followed James' effort with 15 points, five assists, four rebounds and four steals. Channing Frye filled in admirably for Love, producing 14 points, three rebounds, two assists and a block. Matthew Dellavedova paced the bench with 10 points, seven assists and three rebounds. The Cavaliers remain atop the Eastern Conference, with a slim 2 game lead over the Toronto Raptors. They're home again against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday.

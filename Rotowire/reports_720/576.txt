The Milwaukee Bucks (12 - 12) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (16 - 7) 111 - 106 on Saturday. Milwaukee capped their two - game losing streak with the win. The Bucks shot 57 percent from the field and 64 percent from beyond the arc, dissecting the Clippers' defense quite masterfully. Brandon Knight scored a team - high 22 points, and the Bucks had six players finish in double figures. The Bucks have been wading through a tough stretch of their schedule that will continue as they embark on a four - game Western Conference road trip Monday against the Phoenix Suns. Los Angeles has dropped two straight games. Prior to their most recent losses, the Clippers went on a nine - game win streak in what will probably prove to be the easiest stretch of their schedule this season. Confronted with more top - level teams, the Clippers have buckled, and with Spencer Hawes (knee) sitting out Saturday, they lacked depth in the frontcourt, putting an even greater onus on their starting lineup. Chris Douglas-Roberts returned from a 17 - game absence with an Achilles injury to play six minutes off the bench. Matt Barnes scored a game - high 26 points, and Chris Paul turned the ball over six times in what was an all - around obtuse game for the Clippers. They'll look to end the protraction of their losing streak when they host the Detroit Pistons on Monday.

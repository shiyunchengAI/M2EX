The Houston Rockets defeated the Sacramento Kings, 132 - 98, Wednesday at Toyota Center. The Rockets (19 - 7) made sure this one was over fast as they cruised to their eighth straight victory and continue to be the hottest team in the NBA. Wednesday ended up being a breeze for Houston against a Kings team without DeMarcus Cousins (rest) and Rudy Gay (hip), as MVP-candidate James Harden posted a triple - double of 15 points, 14 assists and 11 rebounds in 30 minutes. Ryan Anderson scored 22 points of his own, while Sam Dekker shined off the bench, scoring a career - high 19 points in just 22 minutes. Each other Rocket starter scored in double figures as the team shot a scorching 59 percent from the field and dished out 40 total assists. For the Kings (9 - 16), things did n't go nearly as smooth without their two best players, as the team they put out on the floor could not keep up with the fast - paced Rockets. Garrett Temple got a spot start and scored a team - high 20 points in 30 minutes, while the next highest scoring total for Sacramento was Anthony Tolliver's 12 points on top of his 10 assists. The Kings struggled shooting from the field, managing to shoot just 42 percent overall, and they only managed to shoot 11 total free throws on the night. To make matters worse, the Kings have now lost six of their last eight games and the organization has little reason to be optimistic going forward. Up next, the Rockets will look to stay hot when they play the Pelicans in Houston on Friday, while the Kings will travel to Memphis on Friday to take on a surging Grizzlies team.

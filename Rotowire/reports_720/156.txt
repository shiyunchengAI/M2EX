The San Antonio Spurs (47 - 9) held off the Phoenix Suns (14 - 42) for a 118 - 111 win on Sunday. This was a much closer matchup than anticipated, with the Suns hanging around all game long. The game was actually tied with six minutes left, but the Spurs went on a 70 run from there to ultimately decide the game. San Antonio's three - point shooting was the key, as they went 10 - for - 16 from long distance in the victory. They also shot 52 percent from the field, while holding Phoenix to 46 percent on their end. San Antonio hasn’t been playing impressively lately, but they continue to win games. This is the second game in a row where they allowed a double - digit underdog to hang around and score over 110 points. With that in mind, both of those games came without All-Star Kawhi Leonard. In this game, Tony Parker led the team with 22 points with Patty Mills scoring 21 of his own off the bench. LaMarcus Aldridge also played well, as he tallied 19 points and 10 rebounds en route to a double - double. The Spurs next game will be against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday. Phoenix came into this matchup as a 14 - point underdog and nearly pulled out a miraculous win. Alex Len got the start for the injured Tyson Chandler and played great, double - doubling in a 23 - point, 13 - rebound performance. The bench was what kept the Suns around though, as Jon Leuer, Mirza Teletovic and Archie Goodwin all scored at least 13 points while combing for 18 total rebounds. On deck for the Suns is a matchup with the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday in the second half of a back - to - back set.

The Golden State Warriors (56 - 13) won their third game in four nights Saturday with a 106 - 91 win over the Utah Jazz (31 - 38) at the Oracle Arena. Golden State accomplished a rare feat Saturday, even by its lofty standards. The Warriors were the first team to score 100 points on the Jazz in nearly a month, a span of 12 games. Stephen Curry scored a game - high 24 points and Leandro Barbosa continued his offensive surge with 19 points (8 - 10 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt) off the bench. With the victory, Golden State won the season series against Utah 3 - 1. Utah has now dropped two of its last three after going 8 - 1 to begin March. Granted, both losses came against playoff opponents (Washington and Golden State) and were competitive games overall. Rudy Gobert had a quiet outing on the boards by his standards, pulling down nine rebounds. This was his second straight game without double - digit rebounds after reaching that mark in his previous ten outings. Derrick Favors had a solid outing with 21 points and 11 rebounds to lead the team in both categories and Trey Burke scored 20 off the bench. The Jazz will return home to face the Timberwolves on Monday. Golden State continued its dominance at home Saturday, improving its record at the Oracle Arena to 33 - 2. The Warriors now have a seven and a half game lead over Memphis for the top spot in the Western conference with just 13 games remaining. Golden State had three starters and two bench players score in double figures Saturday, illustrating its scoring depth. The Warriors will host the Wizards on Monday before kicking off a stretch of seven road games in their next eight contests.

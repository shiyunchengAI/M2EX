The Cavaliers opened the fourth quarter with a 13 - point lead, but the Raptors' Louis Williams sparked the comeback to close the gap, scoring Toronto's first nine points of the final period. Williams torched Cleveland for 21 points in the fourth, but the Raptors could n't quite finish the comeback.

Cleveland was coming off an easy win Tuesday against Boston, but got everything Toronto could throw its way Wednesday. Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and LeBron James all had over 20 points. The Cavaliers have now won six of their eight games since the All-Star break. Cleveland has a big matchup on the slate Friday as it will travel to Atlanta to square off with the Hawks. Toronoto's skid continued Wednesday after it briefly stopped Monday against Philadelphia. Kyle Lowry was rested yet again, but Greivis Vasquez filled in admirably. Vasquez finished with 13 assists and six points over 40 minutes. Lou Williams was the big story for Toronto with his huge fourth quarter effort. Toronto will look to get back on track Friday in Charlotte as it starts a three - game road swing.

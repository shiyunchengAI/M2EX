The Dallas Mavericks (14 - 11) defeated the Phoenix Suns (11 - 15) by a score of 104 - 94, Monday night in Dallas. After a back and forth start, Dallas took the lead with about two minutes to go in the first quarter and did not look back. Phoenix put up a fight with a strong 36 point fourth quarter, but Dallas withstood the attack, scoring 27 points of their own, to stay on top. The Suns were playing on the second night of a back - to - back and their shooting percentage indicates that they may have been a bit fatigued, as they shot only 41 percent from the field as a team.

Unfortunately, he did not have too much help other than from Jon Leuer, who finished with 15 points and 13 rebounds, as well as three assists and one steal, in 32 minutes. Brandon Knight added 12 points on 5 - 11 shooting, four rebounds and three assists. Markieff Morris remained out for Phoenix. Dallas really took control when they outscored Phoenix 31 - 15 in the third quarter, stretching their lead to 19, heading into the fourth. Deron Williams was back after missing last game due to illness and was looking great. Williams led the Mavs in scoring with 18 points on 8 - 16 shooting, in 34 minutes. Five other players scored in double digits for the Mavericks, including Raymond Felton and Chandler Parsons, who both finished with 17 points. Dirk Nowitzki showed well, with 14 points on 5 - 10 shooing, seven rebounds and four assists, in 29 minutes.

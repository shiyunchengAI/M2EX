Suns point guard Eric Bledsoe is having by far the most productive season of his career so far, making this cold stretch he has been on over his last four games even more uncharacteristic. His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all, with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting. But this is starting to become a trend, as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 (28 percent) from the field over his last four contests. Despite those horrific shooting numbers, Bledsoe has still managed to average 16 points per game over that stretch, but that is only because of his ability to get to the line. Bledsoe has shot 31 - of - 35 (89 percent) from the charity stripe in those four games, effectively covering up how much the point guard has really struggled as of late.

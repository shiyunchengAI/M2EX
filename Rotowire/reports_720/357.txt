The Dallas Mavericks (20 - 8) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (17 - 11) 99 - 93 on Saturday. Dallas welcomed Rajon Rondo to the team with a victory. Rondo was acquired by the Mavericks in a five - player trade with the Boston Celtics on Thursday. He moved directly into the starting lineup, putting up six points, seven rebounds, nine assists and two steals in 34 minutes. Monta Ellis capitalized on Rondo's passing to score a game - high 38 points. The Mavericks have won three straight games and will try to extend their streak when they host the Atlanta Hawks on Monday. San Antonio has lost four straight games during a stretch of their schedule that's seen them face off against the Western Conference's elite teams (Trail Blazers twice, Grizzlies and Mavericks). Coming into Saturday's game, the Spurs played two triple - overtime games in a row that saw some of their veteran players, like Tim Duncan, play over 40 minutes in each game. So, even without Tony Parker (hamstring) and Kawhi Leonard (hand) available to play, the Spurs decided to rest Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Danny Green, putting them behind the eight ball trying to win Saturday. San Antonio will try to stop the bleeding when they host the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday.

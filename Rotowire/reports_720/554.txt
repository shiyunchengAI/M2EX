Strong scoring performances down the stretch separated the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns, especially in the fourth quarter, where Jamal Crawford shined. The reigning Sixth Man of the Year saw 27 minutes of action and scored 14 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting. Both Chris Paul and Blake Griffin finished with 20 - plus points, while DeAndre Jordan and JJ Reddick also finished in double figures. Jordan, who was initially considered questionable with a thumb injury, played 31 minutes and was dominant around the rim to the tune of 80 percent shooting. Minutes were spread around the Clippers' rotation, with second unit running the floor late in the fourth quarter. Raymond Felton pitched in 18 minutes, while Austin Rivers saw 24 minutes. The Suns were simply unable to match the efficiency that Clippers showed throughout the second half, but did see T.J. Warren, Eric Bledsoe, Alex Len and Brandon Knight finish in double figures.

The Houston Rockets (31 - 14) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (12 - 33) 99 - 87 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Rockets came out hot right from the beginning Sunday, out - scoring the Lakers 52 - 36 in the first half alone. With such a huge lead at half, they were able to coast to any easy victory, securing the 12 - point victory in convincing fashion. While the teams shot similar percentages from the field, the Rockets had a huge advantage from beyond the arc, going 30 percent from deep, while the Lakers shot a meager eight percent from the three - point line. James Harden continued with his MVP-like numbers, finishing with 37 points (12 - 20 FG, 4 - 11 3Pt, 9 - 10 FT), eight rebounds and five assists in 32 minutes. He has had an unbelievable four game stretch, averaging 37 points over that span. With Dwight Howard sitting out with an ankle injury, Joey Dorsey got the start at center, but really struggled to get anything going, finishing with only four points (1 - 3 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and seven rebounds in 25 minutes. Helping to ease the blow of Howard's absence, Josh Smith had a productive game off the bench. He recorded 11 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt) and five rebounds in 25 minutes. He's averaging 12 points and 6 rebounds on the season. Both Corey Brewer and Jason Terry reached double figures in points as well with 10 and 11 points respectively. The Lakers found most of their production from the bench. Carlos Boozer was the biggest contributor, going 9 - for - 13 from the field to score 18 points, while also adding 11 rebounds in only 22 minutes. It marked his seventh double - double of the year, but first since January ninth. Jeremy Lin was the other productive bench player. He struggled with his shot all night (2 - 9 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt), but forced his way to free throw line 14 times, converting on 10 - of - 14 of those attempts to put his game total at 14 points. He also chipped in with six assists as well. Starting at shooting guard with Kobe Bryant done for the season, Wayne Ellington had 13 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt) and five rebounds. He's now scored in double figures three games in a row, despite averaging only 8 points per game on the season. Jordan Hill added 10 points (5 - 9 FG) and seven rebounds. The Lakers had nine players reach the 20 - minute mark in this game. The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Tuesday.

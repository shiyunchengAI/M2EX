The Toronto Raptors (45 - 30) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16 - 59) 113 - 99 on Wednesday. The Raptors got a good team effort in an easy win for them in Minnesota. No Toronto player garnered more than 30 minutes or scored 20 points, but seven players scored in double - figures. They were led by Louis Williams, who put in a team - high 18 points in 26 minutes off the bench. Toronto has the same record as the Chicago Bulls as they'll battle for playoff position the rest of the regular season. The banged up Wolves played just eight players against the Raptors. Probably rookie of the year Andrew Wiggins was the man against his hometown team. He put in 25 points to go along with five boards, five assists, two blocks and one steal. His teammate rookie point guard Zach LaVine had a solid game with 22 points and seven rebounds but recorded seven turnovers and just three assists. Minnesota has lost five straight, they'll play a home game on Friday before heading on a four - game west coast road trip. The Timberwolves will host the Orlando Magic on Friday, as The Raptors will head to Brooklyn to take on the Nets.

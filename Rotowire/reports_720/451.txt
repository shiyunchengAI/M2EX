The Houston Rockets (2 - 3) defeated the Orando Magic (1 - 4) by a score of 119 - 114 in overtime Wednesday at the Toyota Center. Evan Fournier hit a pair of free throws with a second remaining in regulation to force overtime, but the Magic only hit two shots in overtime en route to their fourth loss of the season. Corey Brewer missed two huge free throws late in the fourth quarter, but it did n't cost the Rockets, who have won two straight after starting the season 0 - 3. James Harden scored six of his 28 points in free basketball to ice the win for Houston. The Magic are still a very young team, but are beginning to see what they have in Fournier and Aaron Gordon, who scored a season - high 19 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to go along with eight rebounds. Fournier came a basket shy of posting back - to - back 30 - point outings. He finished with 29 points (11 - 21 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), while ripping down six rebounds and dishing out four assists in a team - high 46 minutes. Rookie Mario Hezonja posted his second goose egg of the season and played just 11 minutes off the bench. While Harden led the Rockets in scoring for a second straight game, Dwight Howard was key in the victory, collecting 14 rebounds and adding 23 points in 31 minutes. Houston's bench was unable to contribute much, forcing the starters to play big minutes and pick up more responsibility on offense. Harden reverted back to shooting poorly from the field (6 - for - 22), but was able to get to the line 17 times, converting on 14 tries. Marcus Thornton provided a nice scoring spark again, finishing with 18 points and a pair of three - point field goals. Orlando will head back home for a date with the undefeated Toronto Raptors in their next game, while Houston travels to Sacramento for a date with the 1 - 4 Kings.

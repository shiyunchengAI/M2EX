DeMar DeRozan has been scoring at will this season and he added yet another 30 - point outing to his tally. He has now scored 30 or more points in 10 - of - 12 games this season and is only the fifth player in the past 54 years to set that mark. Strangely, the Nuggets won many of the statistical categories, as they took the rebounding, assisting, shooting percentage, points off turnovers and free - trow shooting battles in their defeat. Emmanuel Mudiay had one of his best games of the season though, as he tallied 25 points, six rebounds and nine assists. Wilson Chandler continues to dominate off the bench, as his 25 points and 10 rebounds add to his averages of 24 points and 9 rebounds over his last three games. Danilo Gallinari had a strange line, as he scored 21 points on 4 - of - 13 shooting. It was his 13 - of - 13 night from the free - throw line that got him up to that total, as he went 0 - of - 5 from long distance.

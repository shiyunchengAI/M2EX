In a down - to - the - wire game, the Orlando Magic (10 - 8) were able to pull out a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves (8 - 10), finishing up 96 - 93. Orlando is now in the Eastern Conference playoff picture, and the win against the Timberwolves marks the team's fourth straight. Center Nikola Vucevic was a difference - maker for the Magic, recording a team - high 37 minutes and an 18 - point, 12 - rebound double - double. Orlando seemed to ride Vucevic's hot hand all night, as he took a game - high 19 shots. The game also marked the continuation of shooting guard Victor Oladipo's new role as a sixth man, a change that seems to have benefited Orlando's rotations. Oladipo followed up a 19 - point outing off the bench against Boston with 13 points tonight to go with four rebounds, four assists, and three steals. All in all, the Magic appear to be clicking, as they now have a substantial win streak and sit two games above .500. For the Timberwolves, meanwhile, the close loss saw some unorthodox rotations from coach Sam Mitchell. As rookie center Karl-Anthony Towns struggled from the field (2 - for - 11), backup big man Gorgui Dieng stepped in to play a season - high 29 minutes. Dieng looked solid defensively, recording three blocks and a steal while also playing efficient offense, tallying 11 points on 4 - of - 6 shooting. The Louisville alum has seen a steady uptick in minutes recently, and with his elevated play, this could be a continuing trend in the crowded Minnesota frontcourt. With four straight wins under their belt, the Magic will hope to extend the streak even further as they face the Jazz on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves will look to bounce back on Saturday as they prepare to square off against Portland.

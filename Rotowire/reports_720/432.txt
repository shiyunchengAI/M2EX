The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 113 - 102, at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday. The two teams met for the second straight night after going into overtime yesterday, but LeBron James and Kyrie Irving showed little sign of fatigue. With Kevin Love out once again with a knee injury, the Big Two stepped up in his stead, tallying 29 and 31 points, respectively. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker did a pretty good job going blow for blow with the All-Star duo, but received precious little support from anyone else on the Bucks (13 - 14). Meanwhile, the Cavs (21 - 6) were just a bit better with their shot, as they managed success rates of 49 and 56 percent, respectively, from the field and three - point range. Antetokounmpo led the way for Milwaukee with 28 points, five rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. Parker was right behind him with 27 points, two assists, a rebound and a block. However, John Henson (four points, eight rebounds, an assist and two blocks), Tony Snell (three points, one rebound, one assist) and Matthew Dellavedova (two points, three assists, two rebounds, two steals) significantly underwhelmed on the offensive end. In fact, the only other double - digit scorer for the vistors came from the bench, as rookie Malcolm Brogdon went for 11 points, seven assists, five rebounds and three steals. Irving added a career - high 13 assists, six rebounds and a steal to his game - high scoring total. James complemented his points with nine rebounds and six assists. Richard Jefferson drew another start in Love's place and supplied 10 points, four assists and a block. Tristan Thompson turned in just five points but hauled in 15 rebounds. Iman Shumpert and Channing Frye paced the second unit with a pair of 10 - point efforts. The Bucks head back home to face off with the Washington Wizards on Friday evening, while the Cavs remain home to tangle with the Brooklyn Nets on Friday evening as well.

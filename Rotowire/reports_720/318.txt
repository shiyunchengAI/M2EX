It was the closest thing to a one - man show that San Antonio basketball has seen in a while on Wednesday, as superstar Kawhi Leonard propelled his team to victory. Leonard scored a team - high 31 points and pulled down a team - high 10 rebounds. He went 11 - of - 22 from the field, while no other Spur attempted more than nine field goals. He also added three steals on the defensive end in a performance that may help to add fuel to his MVP campaign. Indiana's star small forward, meanwhile, did not have as pleasant a night. Paul George shot just 5 - of - 18, though he still managed a team - high 22 points. Sophomore big man Myles Turner shot 7 - of - 11 for 16 points and added three steals. Indiana managed to hold an advantage in the rebounding column despite no Pacer coming up with more than six boards.

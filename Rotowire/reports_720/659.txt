Goran Dragic's 22 points led the Heat, while Hassan Whiteside's 18 - point, 18 - rebound double - double played a pivotal role in Miami's 48 - 38 rebounding advantage. Dion Waiters and Josh Richardson combined for 31 points on the wings, while Derrick Williams compiled 12 points over just 17 minutes in a start at power forward. James Johnson was nearly as efficient off the bench, supplying 17 points over 27 minutes. Overall, the Heat impressively posted 51 and 48 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. Wall and Beal paced the Wizards with a pair of 34 - point efforts, and the former notably drained five of his six shot attempts from beyond the arc. Marcin Gortat was the only other player to manage double digits in the scoring column, totaling 10 points, 16 rebounds, four assists and five blocks.

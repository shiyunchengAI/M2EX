Harrison Barnes and Wesley Matthews posted over 60 percent of the Mavs' offense by scoring a combined 50 points, but no other player managed to hit double digits in the scoring column. Deron Williams notably was held scoreless over 10 minutes in his return from a calf injury before exiting the game early, although J.J. Barea was able to fill out the stat sheet with nine points, six assists, two rebounds and a steal while once again logging a solid allotment of minutes (28). Isaiah Thomas' 30 points (22 in the fourth quarter) led the way for Boston. Backcourt mate Avery Bradley's 18 - point, 13 - rebound double - double was also pivotal in helping the Celtics overcome 19 turnovers, five of which came from Thomas. Kelly Olynk was the only other double - digit scorer for Boston, posting 10 points.

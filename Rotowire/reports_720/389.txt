The Brooklyn Nets (23 - 31) defeated the Denver Nuggets (20 - 36) 110 - 82 on Monday at the Pepsi Center in Denver. The Nets dominated this game, finishing with the scoring advantage in every single quarter of play. Their shooting percentage was a big reason for that, as they went 47 percent from the field, while the Nuggets finished at just 33 percent. The Nets also out - rebounded the Nuggets 57 - 49, even furthering their advantage and helping them secure an impressive 28 - point victory on the road. It was a total team - effort for the Nets on Monday, as they had seven of their ten players reach double figures in points. At point guard, Deron Williams did the most for the starters, finishing with 16 points (6 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and 12 assists in 33 minutes. After struggling for a long stretch of the season, it looks as if he may have figured things out during the All-Star break, as he's posted two double - doubles in a row, a stretch where he's combined for 28 points and 27 assists. Rookie Markel Brown was in the starting lineup and had the best game of his career. He set career - highs in both points and rebounds, finishing with 10 and 11 respectively. The Nets also saw a huge effort from their bench, with both Brook Lopez and Thaddeus Young doing their part. Lopez posted 19 points (6 - 17 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and nine rebounds, while Young had 15 points (6 - 11 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and five rebounds. Lopez has put in a couple of strong games in a row, combining for 41 points and 33 rebounds over the last two. While most of the Nuggets struggled to get anything going, it was Danilo Gallinari who got hot Monday. He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 22 points. It was his first game shooting over 50 percent from the field since the end of January, so we'll see if he can keep it up moving forward. Coming off the bench, Will Barton had himself a game, recording 15 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and four rebounds in just 21 minutes. In the two games since coming over from the Trail Blazers, he's now set a new season - high in points during both outings, as he's getting a lot more run on the court with the Nuggets than he was with his previous team. With Wilson Chandler sitting out, Darrell Arthur moved into the starting lineup and posted 10 points (5 - 15 FG) and seven rebounds. It was only his second start of the year, so it was good to see him have some success. Rookie Gary Harris was the only other Nugget in double figures, as he finished with 10 points (4 - 12 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 3 FT) of his own. The Nets' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Nuggets will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.

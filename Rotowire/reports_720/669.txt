The San Antonio Spurs (19 - 13) defeated the Houston Rockets (21 - 8) 110 - 106 on Sunday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio. Both teams put up nearly identical shooting numbers in this matchup. The Spurs went 47 percent from the field and 37 percent from the three - point line, while the Rockets shot 49 percent from the floor and 36 percent from beyond the arc. The difference in this game came down to turnovers, as the Spurs defense was able to force the Rockets into a season - high of 25. It gave them enough of an advantage to seal the victory. The Spurs were led by Danny Green, who had a team - high of 24 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt), while also recording five steals. He got to the free throw line 10 times, and converted on nine of those attempts. The five steals were a season - high, and the points were well above his season average of 13 points per game. With Tony Parker sitting out, Cory Joseph took his spot in the starting lineup as the point guard. He shot well, going 6 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 14 points in 34 minutes. He also had six rebounds and four assists. But without Parker, the Spurs also leaned on their other veterans with both Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili getting plenty of touches. Duncan finished with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 5 FT) and eight rebounds, while Ginobili came off the bench to score 15 points (5 - 7 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and four assists. It was a nice win for the Spurs over a quality opponent. Despite taking the loss, the Rockets had a few players that played well. James Harden led the Rockets, going 10 - for - 18 from the floor and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 28 points. He also added five assists, but uncharacteristically turned the ball over nine times, which was the most he's had all season. He was a big reason for the team turnover difference that really hurt the Rockets. Coming off the bench, Corey Brewer came out firing. He went 8 - for - 11 from the field and 6 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points. It was a season - high for Brewer, as he seemingly could n't miss for the majority of the game. The other big contribution came from Dwight Howard who had a monster line of 24 points (11 - 13 FG, 2 - 7 FT) and 17 rebounds. After scoring only six points on Friday against the Grizzlies, it was nice bounce back game for Howard. The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday, while the Rockets will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Monday.

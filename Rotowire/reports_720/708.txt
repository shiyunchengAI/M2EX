The league's top two scorers squared off in epic proportions on Sunday as the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans, 101 - 92. The Thunder (13 - 8) now sit at five games above .500 and are narrowly trailing the Rockets and Grizzlies for the fourth - best record in the Western Conference. The bigger story from Sunday, however, was point guard Russell Westbrook's fifth straight triple - double. Westbrook scored 28 points, had a whopping 17 rebounds, and dished out 12 assists. Westbrook's streak of five games with a triple - double is the best of his career and the longest since Michael Jordan's seven - game streak in 1989. The All-Star's effort helped to propel the Thunder to victory on Sunday, though solid perimeter defense advanced the team's cause. The Pelicans were held to under 37 percent shooting from the field and 6 - of - 28 from three - point range. The Thunder offense, meanwhile, shot almost 47 percent on the night, with solid contributions from guard Victor Oladipo (15 points) and bench big man Enes Kanter (17 points, 10 rebounds). For the Pelicans (7 - 14), meanwhile, 37 points for league - leading scorer Anthony Davis was not enough to earn the win. In addition to the scoring output, Davis had 15 rebounds, two steals, and four blocks. The Pelicans struggled aside from Davis, however, as the rest of the starting five combined for just 25 points. The team also saw a rebounding deficit despite Davis's strong performance on the boards, as the Thunder held a 59 - 51 advantage on the glass. The Thunder will visit the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, while the Pelicans will host the Memphis Grizzlies.

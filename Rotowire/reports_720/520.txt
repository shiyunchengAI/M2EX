The Memphis Grizzlies (23 - 19) stifled the New York Knicks (20 - 22) en route to a 103 - 95 win Saturday. This game was tight throughout, but Memphis buckled down over the final 12 minutes for an impressive win. In fact, the game was tied going into the fourth quarter and the Grizzlies outscored the Knicks 30 - 22 to pull out the win. The rebounding has been a big issue for Memphis all season, but they won that battle 44 to 36 here. They also shot an efficient 5 - for - 10 from long distance, with some big three's late to secure the victory. The Knicks came into this game hot, but they simply couldn’t muster up enough offense late to prevail with a big road win. The offensive struggles have to be taken into context though, as the Knicks were without All-Star Carmelo Anthony for this game. Kristaps Porzingis stepped up in Anthony's absence, by tallying 17 points, four rebounds, two assists and two steals in the loss. Langston Galloway got his first start of the season and played very well, as he scored 11 points to go along with 11 rebounds and five assists. New York has a good chance to win in their next game though, as they host the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday. Memphis has been playing much better lately and they appear to be back to their grit - n - grind style of play. They held the Knicks to just nine points in the first nine minutes of the fourth quarter and really buckled down late to seal the win. Marc Gasol was the star of the night though, as he scored a season - high 37 points to go along with eight boards. Jeff Green has been struggling recently, but he scored 18 points off the bench here in an impressive performance. The Grizzlies shot 48 percent from the field and 50 percent from three - point range, which is one of their best offensive games all year. Up next is a big game in Memphis, as they have their annual Martin Luther King Day game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday.

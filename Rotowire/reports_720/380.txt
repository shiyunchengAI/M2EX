The Detroit Pistons (40 - 35) defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder (52 - 23) Tuesday night at the Palace of Auburn Hills, 88 - 82. With the Thunder now locked into the Western Conference's third position, Oklahoma City took the opportunity to rest Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. Their offense clearly suffered in their absence, as the Thunder committed more turnovers (19) than assists (16) and scored a meager nine points in the third quarter, which allowed Detroit to turn a 48 - 46 halftime deficit into a 71 - 57 lead heading into the fourth quarter, more than enough to stave off a final push from the Thunder. Marcus Morris scored 24 points on an efficient shooting night (9 - 13 FG, 1 - 1 3PT, 5 - 5 FT) to lead the Pistons. Tobias Harris scored 17 (6 - 14 FG) and added seven rebounds and three assists. Andre Drummond added his league - leading 62nd double - double with 13 points (6 - 9 FG) and 15 rebounds. Detroit shot just 4 - 19 (21 percent) from three - point land and 38 percent overall, but they pulled down 16 offensive rebounds to produce just enough offense to win. The scoring load for the Thunder fell squarely on Russell Westbrook's shoulders, as he hoisted up 28 shots and tied Morris's game - high 24 points (8 - 28 FG, 2 - 8 3PT, 6 - 9 FT). Enes Kanter added a double - double with 14 points and 14 rebounds (six offensive), but not a single other Thunder player reached double figures. Oklahoma City shot just 38 percent from the floor and missed eight free throws (14 - 22, 64 percent) as they clearly missed Durant's presence. The Pistons next host the Mavericks on Friday. The Thunder return home to host the Clippers on Thursday.

It was a low - scoring game as the Lakers met the Jazz in Utah on Thursday. Low scores have become the tendency for opponents of the Jazz, as center Rudy Gobert has been an absolute force on the defensive end. The French big man followed up comments to the media about his All-Star snubbing by blocking five shots and coming down with 13 rebounds against LA. Newly-minted All-Star Gordon Hayward, meanwhile, led the team's offense with 24 points. Hayward shot 7 - of - 14 from the field and 9 - of - 10 from the free - throw line. It was not a good offensive night for either team, though, as both clubs shot under 43 percent on the night. The Lakers' struggles were primarily a product of poor play from their starters. The starting five combined for only 32 points and four assists. Off the bench, sixth man Lou Williams scored 20 to lead the team. Rookie Ivica Zubac had his second career double - double with 16 points and 10 rebounds.

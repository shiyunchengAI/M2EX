A trio of 20 - point - plus efforts and a 17 - rebound night helped hand the Cavs a surprising home loss, their first defeat of the season overall. Dennis Schroder's season - high 28 points led the way, while Kent Bazemore put together a stellar 25 - point tally while often going up against LeBron James' typically stingy defense. Dwight Howard dominated down low with 17 boards, 15 of them on the defensive glass. Atlanta managed a strong 51 percent success rate from the field, helping to key the victory. Kyrie Irving posted 29 points, which came on a season - high 27 shot attempts. Kevin Love's 24 - point, 12 - rebound double - double was next, while LeBron James posted 23 points. Poor shooting was Cleveland's undoing, as they posted a 37 percent success rate from the field, and 26 percent on 42 shot attempts from beyond the arc.

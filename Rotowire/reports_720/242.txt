The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 97 - 81 at Staples Center on Sunday. The Trail Blazers (35 - 38) picked up a third win in a row and are heating up at the right time, given the Nuggets loss earlier Sunday, they are now tied for the eighth seed in the Western Conference. In addition, they host the Nuggets on Tuesday in an important game in the battle for the final playoff spot out West. Depth made the difference for Portland, as their bench ran seven players deep, while the Lakers (21 - 52) totaled nine players in rotation. Brandon Ingram (knee) was sidelined in the contest. Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum were not spectacular, but did enough on the offensive end to keep the Blazers ahead, while the Lakers 39 percent shooting effort was far from enough to match that of Portland. Lillard finished with 22 points, five assists, seven rebounds and three steals and McCollum added 13 points on 5 - of - 13 shooting. Allen Crabbe totaled 28 minutes off the bench and pitched in 18 points and six boards, while Al-Farouq Aminu fell one points shy of a double - double and went for nine points and 10 rebounds across 26 minutes of action. D'Angelo Russell matched Lillard's 22 points. Jordan Clarkson did not find a rhythm at any point and finished with just 10 points on 4 - of - 16 shooting, while Tyler Ennis led the bench with 14 points, five assists and three rebounds. Next up, the Blazers host the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, while the Lakers play the same night and host the Washington Wizards.

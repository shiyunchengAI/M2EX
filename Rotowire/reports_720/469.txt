The Miami Heat (20 - 25) fell to the Milwaukee Bucks (23 - 22) 109 - 102 on Tuesday at the AmericanAirlines Arena. In a game between the sixth and seventh seeds in the East, Milwaukee prevailed thanks in part to an excellent shooting performance. The Bucks finished the night shooting 55% from the floor as a team. Miami entered Tuesday's contest without Luol Deng and Chris Andersen, but things got worse when Dwayne Wade exited the game with a hamstring injury. Although Wade did n't injure the same hamstring that sidelined him earlier this month, it was still severe enough to force him from the game. Milwaukee improved to 13 - 12 on the road after Tuesday's victory. Power forward Ersan Ilyasova left the game with a groin injury and did not return, but the Bucks were resilient. Milwaukee had seven players score in double figures, with four of them coming off the bench. The Bucks will look to further solidify their playoff position Thursday against the Magic in Orlando. Miami was coming off an impressive win in Chicago on Sunday, but a rash of injuries left it thin against Milwaukee. Danny Granger got the start in Deng's place and posted 14 points, six rebounds, and two assists over 36 minutes. Hassan Whiteside, who garnered national attention with his 12 block performance against the Bulls on Sunday, had another strong game. Whiteside moved into the starting lineup and finished the game with 16 points and 16 rebounds, but ironically did not record a block against the Bucks. The Heat have two days off to get healthy before taking the floor Friday against the Mavericks.

The Utah Jazz completely dismantled the visiting Detroit Pistons on Friday, 110 - 77. Utah (25 - 16) was firing on all cylinders on Friday, excelling on both ends of the floor. After a stagnant 14 - point first quarter, Utah quickly ran away with the rest of the game. The team drained 16 three - pointers while shooting over 53 percent from the field and 51 percent from beyond the arc. On defense, the Jazz came away with 10 steals and blocked six shots while holding their opponent to under 40 percent shooting from the field. They also crushed the Pistons on the glass, out - rebounding Detroit 48 - 35. On offense, the team's success was due largely to a combination of guards George Hill and Rodney Hood, who scored 22 and 27, respectively. The duo was responsible for 12 of the three - pointers that made up Utah's barrage of shots from deep. Defensively, elite rim protector Rudy Gobert anchored one of Utah's most impressive outings of the season. Gobert led the team with 11 rebounds and blocked three shots. It was a miserable game for the Pistons (18 - 24), who had suffered a 20 - point loss at the hands of Golden State the night before. Detroit was simply suffocated on offense, shooting just over 39 percent from the field and hitting only six three - pointers. The Pistons' top scorer was Tobias Harris, who scored only 13 on 4 - of - 12 shooting. Only three Pistons scored in double digits. While it was an impressive individual rebounding night for Andre Drummond, who walked away with 19 boards, the team was massively out - rebounded. Utah will host the Magic on Saturday, while the Pistons will visit the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.

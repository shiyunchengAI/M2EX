For the Detroit Pistons, the starting five did most of the heavy lifting on Wednesday. Every starter scored at least 13 points, while no one on the bench scored more than 12. Point guard Reggie Jackson shot 10 - of - 20 and scored a team - high 26 points, while All-Star big man Andre Drummond pulled down a whopping 17 rebounds. Forward Marcus Morris stuffed the stat sheet with 14 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists on the night. The Pistons finished shooting almost 50 percent and held a massive 60 - 32 rebounding advantage over the Hawks. It was just a 38 percent shooting night for the Hawks in what was a dismal performance. All-Star big man Paul Millsap scored 21 points to go with eight rebounds and four assists. That was about it for Atlanta, though, as no other player scored above 13 and the team consistently struggled. The Hawks finished with only six three - pointers on the night.

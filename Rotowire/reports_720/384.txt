The Miami Heat (35 - 43) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (33 - 44) 105 - 100 on Tuesday at American Airlines Arena in Miami. With just four games left in the season following this one, this was another huge win for the Heat, who have now moved just a half game back from the Boston Celtics for the eighth and final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. They had previously lost four in a row and seven of their last ten, so this was a huge sigh of relief for the Heat. Conversely, it was very tough loss for the Hornets, who also remain in reach of that final playoff spot. The loss brings them to two games back from the Celtics, so they're officially in desperation mode for their final five outings. The Heat were the superior shooters in this game, going 49 percent from the field, while the Hornets finished at 43 percent. They were led by point guard Goran Dragic, who scored a team - high of 28 points (10 - 16 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 8 FT), to go along with five assists and two steals. His shot looks to be dialed in at the moment, as he's combined to shoot an impressive 16 - for - 26 from the field to score 43 points over his last two games. Luol Deng also played a big factor in the win. He posted 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and six rebounds, while playing 41 minutes. After recording just three points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field in Sunday's game against the Pacers, he got back on track with this line, and the Heat will need him to continue to stay hot if they want to push themselves into the playoffs. Dwyane Wade had a strong showing as well with 19 points (6 - 17 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 7 - 10 FT) and five assists. He did have a season - high of seven turnovers though, so it was n't all good for the guard. It was Gerald Henderson that kept the Hornets close though. Henderson went 11 - for - 18 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 29 points before fouling out. It was his second highest points total of the season, as he was able to shoot higher than 60 percent from the floor. Kemba Walker had decent showing as well. In 39 minutes, he finished with 17 points (7 - 20 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT), four assists and three steals. He's now combined for 41 points and six assists over his last two games, but he'll need to do even more if the Hornets want any chance at sneaking into the playoffs. Recording a double - double, Bismack Biyombo chipped in with 12 points (4 - 6 FG, 4 - 6 FT), 12 rebounds and four blocked shots. Getting the start and extended playing time with both Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller sidelined, Biyombo was able to record one of his better statistical outings of the season. Mo Williams added 15 points (5 - 17 FG, 0 - 4 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and four assists off the bench. The Heat's next game will be at home against the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, while the Hornets will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday.

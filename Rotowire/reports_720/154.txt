The host Dallas Mavericks (17 - 13) defeated the Chicago Bulls (16 - 12) by a score of 118 - 111, on Saturday night. The game was a back - and - forth nail - biter, which featured 15 lead changes and was tied 108 - 108 with 2:54 left in the game. Dallas grinded out the last few minutes with some solid defense, including a big steal which led to a basket that put them up by four with 50 seconds left. The Bulls then gave up an unforced turnover on a five - second inbound violation that destroyed their chance of victory. Chicago came into this game after a solid win on Christmas day and while they are still missing two big pieces in Joakim Noah and Mike Dunleavy, being short - handed on this second night of a back - to - back could be part of the reason why they collapsed late in the fourth. Five players scored in double digits for the Bulls. The high - point man was Derrick Rose, who finished with 25 points (12 - 20 FG), five rebounds and four assists, in 36 minutes. Nikola Mirotic poured in 23 points on strong 6 - 10 shooting from the field (4 - 7 3PT, 7 - 11 FT), along with seven rebounds, three blocks, two steals and one assist, in 40 minutes. Pau Gasol finished with 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 4 - 4 FT), nine rebounds, three assists and three blocks, in 38 minutes. The Bulls starters were forced to play a lot of minutes in this one, which again could have affected their play late in the game. Chicago did however shoot a strong 53 percent from the field. Dallas also had six players score in double digits. J.J. Barea had a fantastic game filling in at starting PG for the injured Deron Williams. Barea finished with 26 points, while shooting a brilliant 7 - 8 from behind the arc, along with five assists, in 32 minutes. Chandler Parsons dropped in 20 points (8 - 15 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt), five rebounds, five assists and two steals, in 35 minutes off the bench. Zaza Pachulia tallied a solid double - double with 17 points and 12 rebounds, in 29 minutes. The Mavericks shot 48 percent from long range and hit 22 - 28 free throws. With this win Dallas is now 6 - 6 against the East. Next Dallas will host Milwaukee on Monday and look to go above .500 against the pesky East. The Bulls will have their hands full once again, as they host Toronto on Monday for what should be a great Eastern Conference battle.

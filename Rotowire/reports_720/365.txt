Statistics are a strange thing and they're even more bizarre when looking at this box score. The Bucks actually won the shooting percentage, rebounding battle, fastbreak points, points in the paint and assist - to - turnover ratio differentials, despite losing the game. No team led by more than 10 points, but there were only five ties and four lead changes. DeMar DeRozan once again carried the Raptors, as he tallied 26 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Kyle Lowry finished with 19 points, five rebounds and six assists, hitting numerous big shots late to cap the win. Giannis Antetokounmpo continued his MVP form for the Bucks, accumulating 29 points, six rebounds and 11 assists in the defeat. Both benches struggled in this game, with Toronto getting 28 bench points to Milwaukee's 24. These two teams will have a rematch on December 12 in Toronto.

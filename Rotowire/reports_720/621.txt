The superstars on both the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors failed to show up in the box score and fell below their season averages, for the most part, although the Warriors still pulled out an easy victory on efficient team shooting. Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin combined for just 37 points on 41 shots from the field, while the Clippers shot 40 percent from the field as a unit. The Clippers bench provided help, like that of Jamal Crawford's 21 points, but in the end it was far from enough to cut into the lead. On the other side, the Warriors saw Stephen Curry uncharacteristically fail to make a three - point shot, as he finished 0 - of - 8 from behind the arc and just 7 - of - 16 from the field. Draymond Green and Klay Thompson led Golden State, where Thompson led all scorers with 24 points and Green finished with 22 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals on 8 - of - 10 shooting.

The New York Knicks (3 - 4) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (1 - 5) at home on Sunday, putting an end to their three - game losing streak. Star small forward Carmelo Anthony led the way for the Knicks with 24 points while also tacking on eight rebounds in the hotly - contested game. Facing a tough challenge from opposing center Roy Hibbert (18 points,10 rebounds), New York big man Robin Lopez was able to effectively crash the glass, posting a 14 - point, 13 - rebound double - double. The win marked the end of a three - game losing streak for the Knicks, as well as the team's first win at home on the season. Despite the victory, the Knicks' shooting woes persisted, as the team shot just 39 percent from the floor and 33 percent from beyond the three - point arc. Despite keeping it close, the Lakers were unable to avoid the loss, falling to just 1 - 5 on the season. The Lakers' issues with efficiency and shot selection were on display in New York, as the team shot a dismal 38 percent from the floor and recorded just 19 assists on the night. 20 - year veteran Kobe Bryant struggled again on Sunday, making just six of his team - high 19 shot attempts. Rookie D'Angelo Russell also continued his slow start to the season, posting just six points in 28 minutes of action. The Lakers will look to recover from their funk on Tuesday as they travel to Miami to take on the Heat. Meanwhile, the Knicks will look to even out their record on Tuesday in Toronto.

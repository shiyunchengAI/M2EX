The Detroit Pistons (30 - 47) dealt a crushing blow to the Miami Heat's (34 - 42) playoff chances Saturday with a 99 - 98 victory at The Palace of Auburn Hills. Miami had a golden opportunity to tie Brooklyn in the standings after the Nets were routed in Atlanta earlier Saturday, but let this game slip away for a gut - wrenching loss. The Heat appeared to be on their way to a victory with a seemingly comfortable 12 point lead with 4:13 to go, but the Pistons battled back with a 14 - 3 run. Dwayne Wade, who had been efficient from the floor through three quarters, missed all four of his field goal attempts in the fourth quarter. Wade's miss with 10 seconds to go led to Reggie Jackson's go ahead layup with five ticks left on the clock. The Heat's playoff hopes now hang in the balance with several teams within one game of overtaking them. Miami appeared to be a lock for the playoffs two weeks ago, but a 2 - 6 record over its last eight games has put its post season hopes in serious jeopardy. Dwayne Wade was able to play 35 minutes on a banged up knee, which he aggravated Thursday in Cleveland. He finished with 24 points, but could n't convert down the stretch. The Heat are in direct competition with the Pacers and Hornets for one of the final two spots in the East, which could be a blessing or a curse depending on how they perform against them in their next two games. Miami draws a matchup in Indiana on Sunday before hosting Charlotte on Tuesday. Detroit gave Miami a scare late in their last meeting, but it was able to complete the comeback Saturday with a big win. Reggie Jackson was sensational with 29 points and 11 assists, but did commit seven turnovers. Andre Drummond had 11 points and 17 rebounds. The Pistons are off until Wednesday when they host the Celtics.

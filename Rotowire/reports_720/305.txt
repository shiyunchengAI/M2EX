The Utah Jazz (4 - 6) defeated the New York Knicks (2 - 8) 102 - 100 on Friday. The Jazz were coming off back - to - back losses heading into Friday's game, and their star player made sure they came away with a win. Gordon Hayward scored a season - high 33 points in 38 minutes. Utah has one more game on their five - game Eastern Conference road trip. They'll go on to Toronto to finish off their back - to - back set against the Raptors on Saturday. Carmelo Anthony's 46 points were impressive, but they were n't enough to earn the win for the Knicks. Only one other Knicks player, Pablo Prigioni scored in double - digits. Prigioni finished with 13 points in 29 minutes off the bench. New York is struggling to find their groove this season, and with defensive wing Iman Shumpert going down with right hip contusion Friday, they'll have another hurdle to jump. Shumpert is questionable for the Sunday's game against the Nuggets. They've lost seven straight games.

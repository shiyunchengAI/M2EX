After being traded from Los Angeles to Houston, Lou Williams wasted no time making his presence felt with his new team. In his first three games with the Rockets, Williams averaged 24 points in just over 26 minutes off the bench. However, in his last three games, Williams' production has dipped severely, and his performance Monday was the very worst of them. In Houston's loss to the Spurs, Williams scored just five points and shot a dreadful 1 - of - 10 from the field and 0 - of - 3 from behind the arc. In his last three games, Williams has now shot a combined 6 - of - 29 (21 percent) from the field and has scored a grand total of just 19 points over those three contests. Prior to this brutal stretch for Williams, he had failed to score in double digits just three times in 61 games.

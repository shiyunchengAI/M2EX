The Golden State Warriors defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 112 - 95, at Oracle Arena on Saturday. Golden State was expected to win this game easily with a 22 - point spread and they took care of business. A 100 run to end the second quarter was a huge stretch, as it gave the Warriors an 11 - point lead, which they never relinquished from there. It was a near wire - to - wire win, as Brooklyn's only lead was a one - point advantage for less than a minute in the second quarter. The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive, as the Warriors recorded five more assists than the Nets, while committing five less turnovers. Golden State also dominated the rim protection, as they recorded 11 blocks to Brooklyn's three. The Nets (8 - 49) had a nearly impossible task here, but they did a nice job of hanging around and giving the Warriors a battle. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was a bright spot, as he accrued 16 points and 10 rebounds in the defeat. Brook Lopez really struggled, as he could only muster up nine points, four rebounds and five assists, while committing four turnovers on 3 - of - 13 shooting. Sean Kilpatrick was a nice spark off the bench, providing 15 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and two steals. Trevor Booker recorded a double - double off the bench as well, amassing 12 points and 10 rebounds. On deck for Brooklyn is a road matchup against the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday. The Warriors (49 - 9) have made minced meat of much of the league this season and a home matchup against an eight - win Nets team is simply unfair. Stephen Curry led the team with 27 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals in the absence of Kevin Durant. Klay Thompson accumulated 24 points, four rebounds and four assists. Zaza Pachulia totaled eight points and nine rebounds, while nearly shutting out Brook Lopez. Golden State will face the Philadelphia 76ers on the road for their next game on Monday.

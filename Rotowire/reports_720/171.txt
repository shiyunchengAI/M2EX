The San Antonio Spurs (37 - 23) routed the Sacramento Kings (21 - 38) 112 - 83 on Wednesday at the AT & T Center. San Antonio fans had n't gotten to watch their team play a home game since Feb. 6 against Miami, but Wednesday's performance was worth the wait. The Spurs were down 27 - 26 after the first quarter, but held the Kings to just 11 points in the second as they took over the game. Kawhi led the way with 21 points to help give the Spurs their second win over the Kings in less than a week. Sacramento kicked off a huge eight - game road trip on Tuesday with a convincing 124 - 86 victory over New York. The Kings could n't match that effort Wednesday, however, as they were handled by the Spurs. DeMarcus Cousins had a subpar game by his standards, posting just 14 points and three rebounds to go with five turnovers. Sacramento will resume its road trip Friday in Orlando. Questions about San Antonio's chances this season started to swirl after it dropped its fifth game on its rodeo road trip. Since then, the Spurs have looked like the team that everyone figured would be a contender in the West with three - straight double - digit wins. Marco Belinelli and Manu Ginobili both scored 13 off the bench Wednesday. The Spurs also played suffocating defense, holding the Kings to just 37 percent from the field. San Antonio will return to action Friday when it hosts Denver.

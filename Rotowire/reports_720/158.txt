It's been a rough stretch of three games over the last four days for Kawhi Leonard - - by his standards - - after he got off to a scorching hot start to the month of March. Following his 22 - point performance (20 of which came in the second half) in Tuesday's comeback victory over the Timberwolves, Leonard has now failed to score at least 25 points in each of his last three games after hitting that total in seven of his eight previous games. The All-Star also has n't been shooting the ball at an efficient rate as of late, with Tuesday's 54 percent performance from the field being his best since last Wednesday when he hit 57 percent of his shots in a loss to Portland. In the two games in between, Leonard shot a combined 9 - of - 27 (30 percent) from the field, which was easily his worst two - game shooting stretch of the season.

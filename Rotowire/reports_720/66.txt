Al Horford's 14 points per game this season is his lowest scoring average since his second year in the NBA, but the big man affects the game in so many different ways beyond scoring, most of which do n't even show up in the box score. Two of those ways, however, do show up, and they are his rebounds and assists. The Celtics have great rebounding guards and wings that take the pressure off Horford, but when the big man gets on the boards and distributes, Boston has little problem finding success. Horford recorded six rebounds and six assists in Wednesday's road victory over the Warriors, and when he has recorded those totals this season, the Celtics are 9 - 3. Even more telling is the fact that in those 12 games, Horford is averaging just 12 points, showing that he is making an big impact, even when the scoring column does n't say so.

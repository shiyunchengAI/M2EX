The Los Angeles Clippers (5 - 3) defeated the Phoenix Suns (5 - 5) 120 - 107 on Saturday. Los Angeles has been trading wins for losses lately. They began the season with a two - game win streak, but since then, the Clippers have recorded wins and losses like coin flips. Matt Barnes was moved back into the starting lineup at small forward, and Jamal Crawford moved back to a bench role. Both players played 27 minutes and were positive contributors in plus/minus. Los Angeles will host the Chicago Bulls on Monday before embarking on a seven - game roadtrip. Phoenix was playing the second night of a back - to - back, coming off a loss at home to the Charlotte Hornets. The Suns shot 38 percent from the field, while the Clippers converted 53 percent of their shots, a statistic that tells the game story simply. Phoenix began a six - game roadtrip Saturday, and their next game will be against the Celtics in Boston on Monday.

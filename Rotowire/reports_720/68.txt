The Dallas Mavericks (36 - 38) defeated the Denver Nuggets (31 - 44) 97 - 88 on Monday. Most of the statistics would indicate a Denver win, but there was one glaring stat that kept this game close. It was the turnover differential, as the Nuggets committed 21 turnovers, with the Mavericks committing just three. Those three turnovers actually set a franchise record for the Mavericks, as their franchise - low was four before this game. Denver dominated the shooting and rebounding though, as they shot 44 percent to Dallas' 41 percent and outrebounded them 44 to 34. Despite playing shorthanded, the Mavericks got a much needed win in this matchup. They had lost six of seven before this, but this win put them in a tie for the eight - seed in the west. J.J. Barea was huge off the bench, as he tallied 18 points and 11 assists in the win. Dwight Powell got a rare start and led the starters with 16 points, while also snatching down seven boards. All five Dallas starters scored in double figures in their victory. On deck for Dallas is a matchup with the New York Knicks on Wednesday. Denver's offense really struggled, as they turned the ball over far too often to win. Emmanuel Mudiay was one of the only bright spots, as he totaled 16 points, six rebounds and seven assists. Will Barton was solid off the bench, as he amassed a game - high 23 points and eight rebounds. Kenneth Faried made a return from a six - game absence to contribute nine points and 11 rebounds. Up next for the Nuggets is a matchup with the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.

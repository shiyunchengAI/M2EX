The Milwaukee Bucks (11 - 18) defeated the Phoenix Suns (12 - 17) 101 - 95 on Sunday. The Bucks have been playing some bad basketball of late aside from their historic Golden State Warriors victory, but looked good today. Milwaukee really struggled at the free - throw line, but made up for it by shooting over 50 percent from the field. The second half is when the tides really turned, as the Bucks outscored the Suns by 14 over the final 24 minutes. The Bucks had to play this game without Giannis Antetokounmpo and it really didn’t effect them as much as expected. Khris Middleton and Michael Carter-Williams stepped up in his absence and put in some great lines. Middleton scored a team - high 26 points and dished out seven assists, while Carter-Williams tallied 20 points, nine rebounds and six assists. This is a frustrating team at times, but when they play the second half defense like they did today, they're a tough team to beat. The Bucks have a good chance to add to this win when they host the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday for their next game. The Suns really struggled to get their potent offense going in this game and it's evident through the stats. No player scored more than 18 points and the starters combined for just 52 points. T.J. Warren and Eric Bledsoe both scored a team - high 18 points and went a combined 9 - for - 9 from the free - throw line. The strange thing is that the starters took just 35 shots in the game and committed 12 turnovers. That's a recipe for disaster and it was a miracle they kept it so close with those stats. Phoenix will look to bounce - back on Monday when they play the Utah Jazz.

The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Miami Heat, 94 - 90, on Monday at AT & T Center. For the Spurs (8 - 3), Monday's game marked just the second time this season where the team was able to start their lineup they expected to have out there from the beginning of the season, as Danny Green and Tony Parker have made returns from quad and knee injuries, respectively. Regardless, it was still Kawhi Leonard who led the way for San Antonio in their victory, posting a team - high 24 points and 12 rebounds in 35 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 points of his own while Pau Gasol posted 12 points and eight rebounds, as the Spurs' starting frontcourt carried the team to their third straight victory. Although it did n't come easy in the closing moments, as despite holding an 11 - point lead heading into the final quarter, a late Miami (2 - 7) run made the final seconds somewhat competitive. For the Heat, they continue to struggle as they have now lost their fifth straight game, but center Hassan Whiteside did manage to put together yet another monster performance, scoring 23 points off 9 - of - 11 shooting and grabbing 17 rebounds in 34 minutes. With Goran Dragic out with an ankle injury, however, it was Dion Waiters who led the team in scoring, posting a game - high 27 points in Dragic's absence. Beyond Waiters and Whiteside, Miami did n't get much help, as Tyler Johnson was the only other player to score in double figures, scoring 11 points in 33 minutes off the bench. Offensive struggles continue to haunt the Heat, as they've failed to score 100 points in each of their last five games. Up next, the Spurs will head to Sacramento on Wednesday to take on the Kings, while the Heat will look to end their losing streak at home against the Hawks on Tuesday.

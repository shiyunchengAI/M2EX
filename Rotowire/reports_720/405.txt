The Chicago Bulls (28 - 16) got a much needed win Thursday, beating the San Antonio Spurs (27 - 17) 104 - 81 in at the United Center. Chicago entered Thursday's game after a gutting loss to Cleveland on Monday that had people questioning the direction in which the Bulls season was going. The Bulls started to pull away in the third quarter thanks to a solid combined effort from Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler, and Taj Gibson. The Spurs were held to just 37% shooting from the floor. The Spurs were on a four - game winning streak coming into this game and had won six of its last seven. Kawhi Leonard turned in another solid performance, putting up 16 points and 4 rebounds, but the Spurs were out of this game by the fourth quarter and no starter played more than 27 minutes. The Spurs will wrap up a back - to - back set Friday against the Lakers. Chicago needed to make a statement Thursday against one of the NBA's deepest and well - coached teams. The Bulls came out with aggressiveness on both ends of the floor and were able to out - rebound the Spurs despite missing Joakim Noah. Chicago plays seven of its next eight games on the road, starting Friday in Dallas.

The Utah Jazz defeated the Phoenix Suns 112 - 105 at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Tuesday. The Jazz (14 - 9) claimed their third straight victory and have won seven of their last eight contests. Gordon Hayward added another 20 - plus point performance, contributing 28 points on 8 - of - 16 shooting. Rudy Gobert flashed another brilliant game on both ends of the floor, which has been a major reason for Utah's winning ways of recent, as he scored 22 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and racked up four blocks in 38 minutes. The bench was led by Sheldon Mack, who scored 12 points and dished out four assists in 30 minutes of action. Devin Booker was the lone bright spot for the Suns in the loss, as he scored 21 points on 9 - of - 13 shooting. The resurgent, but streaky Booker, is still maturing in his young career, but when he is on he caused multiple mismatches for the Jazz. Three bench players found double figures for Phoenix, as Alex Len, Leandro Barbosa and Brandon Knight all amassed 20 - plus minutes and 10 - plus points. Next up, the Suns host the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, while the Jazz host the Golden State Warriors.

The Warriors (49 - 12) held off a late run to defeat the Clippers (40 - 23) at ORACLE Arena in Oakland on Sunday afternoon. Golden State, which led by seven at halftime, broke the game open in the third quarter, outscoring Los Angeles 30 - 18 in the period. Stephen Curry spurred a 9 - 2 run in the middle of the quarter punctuated by a jaw - dropping play in which he weaved through four Clippers defenders before splashing in a long, pull - up three - pointer with nine seconds left on the shot clock. The basket put the Warriors up 13 points, and the lead swelled to 16 on the next possession when Draymond Green put in a running layup plus the foul. The Clippers trailed by 19 entering the fourth quarter but went on a 16 - 5 run late in the period, slicing the deficit to just eight with a minute to play. They’d be held scoreless the rest of the way, however, losing for the second time in a row after falling to the Trail Blazers in overtime Wednesday night. Aside from the mini - run in the third quarter, Curry was kept in check, finishing with only 12 points in 32 minutes. Green paced Golden State with 23 points and six rebounds, while Klay Thompson chipped in 21 points, including three three - pointers. Shaun Livingston added 21 points and eight rebounds off the bench in 28 minutes. The Clippers were led by 22 points from Austin Rivers, who made 8 - of - 14 field goal attempts. Chris Paul finished with 14 points and 11 assists, and J.J. Redick added 18 points. DeAndre Jordan contributed six points and 14 boards in 32 minutes. The Clippers were still without Blake Griffin (elbow) and Jamal Crawford (calf). Both players are expected to return in the near future, though each remains out indefinitely. Up next, Los Angeles returns home to host the Timberwolves on Monday night. The West-leading Warriors take on the Suns in Phoenix, also on Monday.

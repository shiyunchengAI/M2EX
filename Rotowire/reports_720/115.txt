The Hornets (8 - 6) mounted a huge comeback to defeat the Kings (5 - 10) 127 - 122 in overtime at Time Warner Cable Arena on Monday. After trailing by 17 points after the third quarter, the Hornets stormed back by outscoring the Kings 38 - 21 in the fourth quarter. Kemba Walker led the way for Charlotte with a season - and game - high 39 points (16 - 23 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), including the go - ahead basket late in the fourth that nearly won the game had it not been for Rudy Gay's game - tying alley - oop off an inbounds play with 1 seconds remaining. As if the loss was n't bad enough, the Kings lost DeMarcus Cousins in overtime due to a stiff back. He finished with a team - high 30 points (13 - 21 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and 11 rebounds. Point guard Rajon Rondo set the Kings' single - game record with 20 assists while adding 14 points, eight rebounds and four steals. He also threw the pass that helped force overtime and has been putting up huge numbers as of late for a Sacramento squad that has been defensively challenged this season. Rondo has four triple - doubles and two double - doubles in his past nine games. It was certainly "Kemba Time" in Charlotte on Monday night, as Walker looked like the guard that led UConn to a National Championship. He was able to get pretty much whatever shot he wanted with Rondo and Darren Collison unable to contain him. With the win, the Hornets remained one of the NBA's best home teams with a 6 - 1 record. Nicolas Batum had an off night shooting the basketball, but nearly contributed a triple - double with the extra frame, finishing with 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists over 43 minutes. The Kings wrap up a five - game road trip Wednesday against the Bucks; the Hornets play the fourth of a seven - game homestand against the Wizards.

The Toronto Raptors (36 - 18) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (32 - 23) 98 - 85 on Sunday. The 13 - point margin is not indicative of how this game was played, as it was a close grinder throughout. The Raptors ended the game on an 8 - 1 run and really stifled the Grizzlies late. Both teams struggled from the field, with Toronto shooting 41 percent, with Memphis shooting 37 percent on their end. The Raptors actually held the Grizzlies starters to just 33 points in the win. Memphis came into this game as a sizable underdog and just couldn’t muster up enough offense to hang around. Zach Randolph was the only starter who played well, as he amassed 18 points and six rebounds in the defeat. The bench was very good though, as Lance Stephenson, Vince Cater and Mario Chalmers all scored between 16 and 17 points. The Grizzlies next game will be much easier, as they host the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday. Toronto played their first home game in nearly a month and didn’t disappoint. DeMar DeRozan led the team with 21 points, while going 9 - for - 10 from the free - throw line. Kyle Lowry tallied 18 points, seven assists and four rebounds in the victory. Patrick Patterson and Cory Joseph gave the team a nice spark off the bench, as they totaled 25 points and 12 rebounds between the two. On deck for Toronto is a matchup versus the New York Knicks on Monday in the back end of a back - to - back set.

It was an odd statistical night for the Warriors in every sense except the win column on Thursday. The top team in the Western Conference reached the free - throw line only eight times and hit just four of its attempts in the win. Golden State saw an unusual off night from beyond the arc, hitting only nine threes on 28 percent shooting. Reigning MVP and scoring champ Steph Curry had more rebounds than points, ending with a line of eight points, eight assists, and 10 rebounds. Curry shot just 3 - of - 14 on the night. Fellow All-Star Draymond Green had a strangely similar line, shooting 2 - of - 12 for five points to go along with seven assists and 11 rebounds. Former MVP Kevin Durant added 17 points, a team - high 14 rebounds, and yet another eight assists. Golden State finished with a ridiculous 41 assists on 45 shots, just the sixth game ever in which a team assisted on over 90 percent of its shots. For New York, it was a dismal offensive night, as only three players scored in double digits and no starter scored more than 10. Point guard Brandon Jennings had 10 points to go along with six rebounds and six assists, while bench guard Justin Holiday led the team with 15 points and five steals. The team shot just 40 percent and made only five three - pointers on the night.

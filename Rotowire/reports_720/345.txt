The Milwaukee Bucks (32 - 47) narrowly edged the Philadelphia 76ers (10 - 70) on Sunday, 109 - 108, in overtime. Guard Khris Middleton exploded on both ends of the floor, finishing with 36 points and four steals. His partner in crime, multi - position phenom Giannis Antetokounmpo also had a big night, narrowly missing out on a 5x5. The Greek Freak had 14 points, nine rebounds, seven assists, five blocks, and three steals. Big man John Henson also impressed with 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Sixers, meanwhile, became the second team ever to hit 70 losses just days after the Golden State Warriors achieved the exact opposite feat. Philly did n't go down easily, however, as they took Milwaukee to overtime on Sunday. Point guard Ish Smith scored 22 and neared a triple - double with nine rebounds and eight assists. Forward Jerami Grant also contributed 21 points in what was an impressive night for the youngster. Both teams will close out what has been a disappointing season next week.

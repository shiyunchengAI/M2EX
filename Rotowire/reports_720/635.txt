The Indiana Pacers (33 - 43) throttled the Charlotte Hornets (32 - 43) 93 - 74 on Friday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. This game was a must - win for both teams as Charlotte and Indiana are battling for one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. While Indiana was n't exactly overwhelming on the offensive end, Charlotte was dreadful. The Hornets shot 30 percent from the floor for much of the game, but were able to bump that number up to 35 percent when the game was already well out of hand. With the win, the Pacers locked up the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Hornets, which could be the deciding factor for the eighth spot in the East. Charlotte was already missing Cody Zeller and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist coming into this contest, and Al Jefferson missed the second half with continued knee soreness. The dearth of depth was ultimately too much to overcome for the Hornets, and their usual scorers did not come close to their usual offensive production. Kemba Walker was held to six points on 1 - of - 9 shooting and Mo Williams had nine points on 4 - of - 11 shooting. The Hornets will look to bounce back Saturday against the 76ers before a crucial matchup with the Heat on Tuesday. Indiana was able to pull away in the second and third quarters by playing a suffocating brand of defense. The Pacers allowed just 22 points over those two quarters, while pouring in 48 points themselves. Rodney Stuckey and C.J Watson provided solid scoring numbers off the bench, combining for 28 points. The Pacers leap - frogged the Hornets in the standings, but remain 2 games behind the Celtics and Heat and two games behind the Nets. Indiana only plays one of those teams, Miami, down the stretch. That matchup is on the docket for Sunday in Indiana.

The Wizards were expected to win this game easily against a Sixers team without Joel Embiid and they did just that. The middle quarters were especially decisive, as Washington outscored Philadelphia, 65 - 41, in that 24 - minute stretch. Shooting was the key difference, with the Wizards shooting 48 percent to Philadelphia's 41 percent. Jahlil Okafor had not played four four - straight games, but he got the start here in the absence of Embiid to lead the team with 26 points and nine rebounds. Ersan Ilyasova was second on the team with 18 points and seven rebounds. All five starters scored in double figures for the Wizards, as they destroyed the Philadelphia starting unit, 81 - 57. John Wall was the player of the game, as he accumulated 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Bradley Beal provided 20 points of his own, while Marcin Gortat recorded a double - double.

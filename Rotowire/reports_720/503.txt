The Phoenix Suns (15 - 14) defeated the Washington Wizards (19 - 7) 104 - 92 on Sunday. Phoenix has won three straight games. Alex Len continues to start at center. He put up eight points, eight rebounds and four blocks in 24 minutes Sunday. Eric Bledsoe led the way with 17 points and nine rebounds in 29 minutes, while the Suns had six players finish in double - figures for scoring. Phoenix will host the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday. Washington saw their six - game win streak come to an end with Sunday’s loss. Rasual Butler scored 17 points off the bench, filling his role well, but the Wizards struggled putting the ball in the basket as a team. They shot 41 percent from the field and 21 percent from beyond the arc. Though Washington only committed 11 turnovers, they allowed 20 easy points off the giveaways, putting the game out of reach given their lack of efficiency on offense. The Wizards will host the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday.

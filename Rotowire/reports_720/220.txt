The Magic (18 - 13) pulled away in the second half to defeat the Pelicans (10 - 21) 104 - 89 at Amway Center on Monday. Orlando has found success the past month largely due to the effort of Nikola Vucevic, who posted a season - high 28 points on 14 - of - 21 shooting from the field while adding eight rebounds and seven assists over 37 minutes. The Magic shot 55 percent on the night and destroyed the Pelicans in the paint, but were also incredibly efficient from beyond the arc, shooting 7 - of - 17. The Pelicans got a brief scare in the third quarter when All-Star Anthony Davis went to the locker room after receiving a knee to the groin area. Fortunately he was able to return and finished with a team - high 20 points (9 - 16 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 5 FT) to go along with eight rebounds. The minor injury caused a down night by Davis's standards as he had posted at least 24 points and 12 rebounds in his previous three contests. New Orleans did however get a big effort from Norris Cole, who scored a season - high 17 points on 8 - of - 14 shooting with eight rebounds and three assists over 30 minutes. Behind Vucevic were a slew of contributors, including Evan Fournier, who had another nice game shooting the ball Monday. Fournier has hit at least two 3 - pointers in his past four games and is shooting 46 percent from downtown in his past five. The Magic have now won six of their past eight games and are in the thick of the Eastern Conference playoff race with a matchup against the Nets set for Wednesday in Orlando.

The Bulls, perhaps surprisingly, shot well from beyond the arc Saturday, hitting 9 of 21 in their rout of the Pacers. The Pacers who have been known to shoot the three, were out - done as they went 7/18 from distance. The Bulls also took care of business from the free throw line, hitting 19 of 21, while the Pacers only managed to earn nine free throw attempts. Chicago dominated the glass and were plus - 14 in rebounds, including 13 offensive rebounds. Jeff Teague was held scoreless in 28 minutes, but dished eight assists. The Pacers had 13 players hit the court, with nine of them logging at least 15 minutes. Myles Turner, Paul George and Thaddeus Young all shot over 60 percent from the field. Rajon Rondo was the only Bulls' starter to shoot under 50 percent.

The Boston Celtics defeated the visiting Atlanta Hawks, 111 - 103, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference first - round playoffs Friday at TD Garden. The Hawks lead the series, 2 - 1. Boston came out with some fire early, as they took a 37 - 20 lead after the first. The Hawks overcame a 20 - point deficit to take a lead in the fourth quarter, but couldn’t overcome a late fury by Boston. The Celtics starters outscored the Hawks starters by 13 points and were led by a 42 - point gem from Isaiah Thomas. Game 4 will be on Sunday, when the Celtics look to even up the series in their home building. The Hawks played hard, but simply built too deep of a hole to overcome in this game. Despite Paul Millsap and Al Horford grabbing double - digit rebounds, both players failed to reach double figures in scoring. Jeff Teague led the team with 23 points and also dished out five assists. Kent Bazemore provided 20 points and eight rebounds of his own. Dennis Schroeder led all bench scorers in this game with 20 points as well. Atlanta shot just 25 percent from three - point range in this loss, as they missed 27 of their 36 attempts. To say this was a must win for Boston would be a drastic understatement. Isaiah Thomas was the player of the game, as he scored a career - high 42 points, which also happens to be a playoff - high for this current season. Jonas Jerebko got a rare start and double - doubled in a 11 - point, 12 - rebound, four - assist performance. Evan Turner also got a rare start and tallied 17 points, seven assists and five steals. Six players played at least 31 minutes and the once clustered rotation has turned into a short one for the postseason.

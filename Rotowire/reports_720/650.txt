The Brooklyn Nets (19 - 28) took down the Los Angeles Clippers (33 - 16) 102 - 100 on Monday. Deron Williams made his return to the Nets' rotation. He missed the last 11 games with a rib injury. The Nets went 2 - 9 in that stretch, but still remain a threat to grab a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Williams scored 15 points in 29 minutes to help give his squad the win over a very good Clippers team that went 11 - 4 in the month of January. Joe Johnson also returned to the Nets after missing Sunday's practice for personal reasons. Johnson scored 22 points to go along with five rebounds and six assists. DeAndre Jordan recorded 22 points (10 - 13 FG, 2 - 12 FT) and 20 rebounds, his fourth game of the season with 20 rebounds or more. J.J. Reddick left the game with back spasms after playing just four minutes and did n't return. The Los Angeles had a 90 - 79 lead with 5:16 remaining, but could n't hold on as the Nets ended the game on a 23 - 10 run. Chris Paul hit a big layup with eight seconds remaining to tie the game at 100. Brooklyn's Jarrett Jack answered with a 17 - foot jumper with one second left on the clock. The Clippers failed to get a shot off, and the Nets were victorious at home. The Nets will play the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday, and the Clippers will take on the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday.

The New Orleans Pelicans (28 - 27) defeated the Miami Heat (22 - 31), 105 - 91. Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson exited the game due to injury and never returned. Davis aggravated a shoulder issue that held him out prior to the All-Star break and will undergo an MRI on Sunday. Ryan Anderson suffered a right knee sprain. After losing his starting spot to Quincy Pondexter, Dante Cunningham started the second half in Anthony Davis’ absence. Norris Cole made his Pelicans debut against the team who traded him, finishing with 12 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal in 30 minutes. Eric Gordon and Tyreke Evans each registered six assists, and Gordon added 24 points and six three - pointers in the win. On the day the Heat learned Chris Bosh’s season would end due to blood clots in his lungs, Goran Dragic underwhelmed in his debut. Backup Mario Chalmers outperformed Dragic, leading to a promotion in the second half, replacing Udonis Haslem in the starting lineup. Dragic provided 12 points, three rebounds, one assist, one steal, and one three - pointer in 33 minutes while Chalmers tallied a team - high 20 points in 37 minutes. Hassan Whiteside grabbed 16 rebounds and blocked five shots while Dwyane Wade recorded a team - high four assists and 19 points in 30 minutes. The Heat host the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday and the Pelicans begin a three - game homestand Monday against the Toronto Raptors.

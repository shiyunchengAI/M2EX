The dynamic duo of LeBron James and Kevin Love continued their outstanding early - season play Saturday. James posted a 25 - point, 14 - assist double - double, while Kevin Love also accomplished the feat with 20 points and 11 boards. The stellar production helped overcome a down night for Kyrie Irving, who drained just three of his 17 shot attempts, producing a season - low eight - point tally. His 0 - of - 5 tally from beyond the arc also marked the first time he's been blanked from long distance this season. The Sixers received another standout effort from Joel Embiid, who totaled 22 points, six rebounds, two assists and four blocks in 25 minutes. Ersan Ilyasova may prove hard to keep on the bench much longer, given that his 21 points, which paced the reserves, was his second double - digit scoring haul in as many games since joining Philadelphia.

The Philadelphia 76ers (15 - 50) defeated the Sacramento Kings (22 - 42) 114 - 107 on Friday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. After being out - scored by 20 points in the second quarter, the Sixers had themselves in a hole, as they were down 64 - 51 at the half. They came out with a big third quarter though, where they out - scored the Kings 37 - 18 to give them just enough of a lead to secure the seven - point win in front of their home crowd. While both teams are likely going to miss the playoffs, it was still a nice win for the Sixers, who notch just their fifteenth victory of the season. The Sixers did n't have the best night shooting the ball, but they still finished at 47 percent from the field and 28 percent from the three - point line as a team. Robert Covington led the way, scoring 24 points (8 - 17 FG, 6 - 12 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), to go along with two assists and three steals. It was the most points he's scored since the beginning of February, as he matched a season - high in hitting six three - point shots.Covington did receive some help though, as Nerlens Noel finished with 16 points (7 - 13 FG, 2 - 2 FT), 12 rebounds and a blocked shot. Noel remains inconsistent with his scoring, but continues to dominate the boards and has grabbed double - digit rebounds in seven of his last eight games. He's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds on the season. The Sixers also got some help from the bench from rookie Jerami Grant. Grant went 5 - for - 7 from the field to score 13 points, while also adding two steals and four blocked shots in 29 minutes. He had gone a combined 1 - for - 7 from the field over his last two games, so it was good to see him get things turned around. Ish Smith added 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), five rebounds and nine assists off the bench as well. Despite taking the loss, DeMarcus Cousins had himself a monster game. Cousins went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 15 - for - 20 from the free throw line to score a game - high of 39 points, while also grabbing 24 rebounds in the process. Cousins continues to play well of late, as this was his fifth straight double - double. Over that five - game stretch, he's averaging 25 points and 16 rebounds, as he's one of the hottest players in the league. Rudy Gay also did his best in keeping the Kings close. In 40 minutes on the court, Gay finished with 24 points (7 - 17 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 9 - 10 FT) and four rebounds. Like Cousins, he's played extremely well over his last five games, averaging 28 points during that span, while shooting over 40 percent in each of those matchups as well.The only other King in double figures was Derrick Williams, who came off the bench for 15 points (5 - 9 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and three rebounds in 31 minutes.

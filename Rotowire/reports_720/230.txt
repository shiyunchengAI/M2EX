The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 116 - 108 Tuesday at Target Center. The Timberwolves (21 - 35) managed to keep pace with the East-leading Cavaliers (38 - 16) for a majority of Tuesday's contest, and they were well within striking distance down the final stretch of the game. That was until LeBron James hit a step back three - pointer with two minutes remaining to take his team's lead from three points to six. At that point, Minnesota was finished. James finished with 25 points on an efficient 10 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with 14 assists and eight rebounds as the Cavaliers walked out of the Target Center with their second straight victory and their sixth win in their last seven games. Kyrie Irving added 25 points of his own, Channing Frye posted a double - double of 21 points and 10 rebounds as Kevin Love's replacement and the newest Cavalier, Derrick Williams, came off the bench to score 13 points Tuesday. As for those Timberwolves, a brilliant performance from Andrew Wiggins ended up not being enough for a team that has lacked a strong supporting cast all season. After scoring 20 points in the third quarter, Wiggins finished the game with 41 points on 16 - of - 29 shooting from the field. Karl-Anthony Towns had yet another productive night as well, scoring 26 points and grabbing eight rebounds, but besides those two, Minnesota failed to get much else offensively from their team. Ricky Rubio did manage to dish out a game - high 16 assists and grab eight rebounds, but he was n't able to produce enough in the scoring column, ending with just five points on 2 - of - 8 shooting from the field. Up next, the Cavaliers will look to continue to build on their lead in the Eastern Conference on Wednesday against the Pacers, while the Timberwolves will travel to Denver on Wednesday to take on the Nuggets.

The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 112 - 106, at BMO Harris Bradley Center on Thursday. The Pelicans checked in to Thursday with an 0 - 8 record, with half of those defeats having come on the road.

He was supported by double - digit scoring performances from three other members of the starting five, as well as a collective 30 points from the bench. E'Twaun Moore was second behind Davis with 20 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal. Tim Frazier posted a 15 - point, 10 - assist double - double, along with five rebounds and a steal. Terrance Jones supplied 10 points, seven rebounds and a block. Buddy Hield paced the bench with nine points, four rebounds and a steal. Solomon Hill and Omer Asik registered a pair of eight - point efforts in reserve roles as well. The Bucks (4 - 4) were led by a game - and - season - high 33 points from Jabari Parker, and added nine rebounds, an assist, a block and a steal. Giannis Antetokounmpo posted a 17 - point, 10 - rebound double - double that also included two blocks, an assist and a steal. Malcolm Brodgon registered 10 points, three rebounds, three assists and a steal to lead the reserves.

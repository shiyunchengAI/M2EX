It was business as usual for point guard Russell Westbrook as the Thunder earned their sixth win in seven games this season. Westbrook shot just 5 - of - 16 and scored just 14 points, well below his average, but posted a double - double with 11 assists. Westbrook turned it on in particular during the third quarter, in which he scored or assisted on all 20 points during a 200 Thunder run. A more efficient double - double came off the bench, with center Enes Kanter scoring a team - high 24 points on 10 - of - 12 shooting to go with 10 rebounds. Kanter played only 21 minutes but still made a significant impact in the scoring column. For Miami, meanwhile, bench scoring was a necessity, as the starting five combined for just 35 points on the night. Forward James Johnson led the team with 18 points, while guard Tyler Johnson and forward Willie Reed scored in double - digits as well.

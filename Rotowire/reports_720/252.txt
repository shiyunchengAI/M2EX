The Minnesota Timberwolves beat the visiting Atlanta Hawks on Monday, 104 - 90. After a tough Christmas Day loss, Minnesota (10 - 21) received a confidence boost as it cruised to a win over the Hawks. The team's young core of Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins, and Zach LaVine all impressed on Monday, scoring 22, 21, and 21 respectively. Towns was particularly potent on offense, as the reigning Rookie of the Year shot a perfect 8 - of - 8 from the field, including three three - pointers, and 3 - of - 3 at the free - throw line. Towns made a big impact on the defensive end as well, recording three blocks. The team was immensely successful while shooting the ball, as they hit 15 three - pointers on over 48 percent shooting. Six of those three - pointers came from LaVine, who is having a breakout season and averaging over 20 points per game for the first time in his career. Atlanta (15 - 16), meanwhile, has crumbled since its hot 9 - 2 start to the season. Once again, the Hawks looked lost on Monday, entering the fourth quarter down by 24 points. Center Dwight Howard interestingly was also perfect from the field as he scored a team - leading 20 points. Howard also had 12 rebounds and two steals. It was not a good overall offensive night for Atlanta, though. The team shot just 42 percent including 25 percent from three - point range, and had 19 turnovers on the night. On Wednesday, the Hawks will host the Knicks and the Wolves will visit the Nuggets in Denver.

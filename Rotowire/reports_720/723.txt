The Boston Celtics (24 - 35) held on in a nail - biter Wednesday to defeat the Utah Jazz (24 - 36) 85 - 84 at the TD Garden. The Celtics led 81 - 73 with just under 2:30 to play, but the Jazz battled back with contributions from Trey Burke, Gordon Hayward, and Rodney Hood to force the game to be decided on the last possession. Gordon Hayward hit the go - ahead shot with one second remaining, but Boston would have the last laugh. Tyler Zeller converted a buzzer - beater under the hoop to give Boston the win. Utah is now 5 - 2 since the All-Star break after suffering Wednesday's heart - breaking defeat. It looked like the Jazz were going to escape with the win after Hayward's jumper, but the Celtics drew up the right play and Zeller sunk the game winner. Rudy Gobert was dominant on the glass once again, pulling down 16 rebounds to go with 10 points. The Jazz will look to bounce back Friday in Philadelphia. Boston did n't let Tuesday's blowout loss to Cleveland bleed into Wednesday as it notched a tough win against a resurgent Utah club. Isaiah Thomas was effective off the bench again, posting his fifth 20 - point performance as a Celtic. Kelly Olynyk returned to action Wednesday, but his impact was minimal as he finished with a rebound and an assist in seven minutes of action. Boston will kick off a three - game road swing Friday in New Orleans.

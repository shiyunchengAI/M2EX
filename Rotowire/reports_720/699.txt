The host San Antonio Spurs took down the Denver Nuggets on Thursday, 118 - 104. The Spurs (33 - 9) remain the league's second - ranked team with Thursday's double - digit win. San Antonio received the unfortunate news on Thursday that veteran big man Pau Gasol had suffered a broken fourth metacarpal bone and will likely miss considerable time. The Spurs' spirits were lifted on the court, however, as the team earned a strong win. For the fifth straight game, superstar forward Kawhi Leonard scored at least 30 points, leading the team with 34. Leonard, who was named an All-Star starter hours before tip - off, played an integral part in the Spurs' third - quarter charge to take a commanding lead. Five Spurs scored in double digits and the team finished the night shooting over 51 percent in what was a strong offensive outing for the powerful team. The Nuggets (17 - 24) had their three - game win streak snapped in San Antonio. Despite the loss, Denver continued to see promising play from breakout sophomore center Nikola Jokic. Jokic dominated with a career - high 35 points along with 12 rebounds and four assists. Guard Will Barton, who once again filled in for an injured Gary Harris, delivered 18 points and dished out seven assists. However, the middling Nuggets were unable to run with the powerhouse Spurs for the entirety of the game, due in large part to poor shooting from their remaining players. Denver finished at just 40 percent shooting on the night. The Spurs will visit Cleveland on Saturday, while Denver will host the Los Angeles Clippers.

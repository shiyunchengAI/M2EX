The Sacramento Kings (9 - 5) defeated the New Orleans Pelicans (7 - 6) 99 - 89 on Tuesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. Despite going into the half even at 49 points apiece, the Kings were able to out - score the Pelicans 50 - 40 in the second half to notch their third victory in as many games. The Kings were able to shoot 48 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line to give them the advantage over the Pelicans, who shot 42 percent from the floor and only 18 percent from beyond the arc. Leading the Kings to the victory was the duo of DeMarcus Cousins and Omri Casspi. Cousins scored 22 points (8 - 18 FG, 6 - 6 FT), and grabbed 12 rebounds, giving him his seventh straight double - double and eleventh on the year. Casspi was in the starting lineup for the first time this season with Rudy Gay sitting out with an Achilles injury. He shot 9 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 22 points in 36 minutes. He's only averaging 7 points in 18 minutes per game this season, so the boost in playing time allowed him to surprise many with the dominant performance. Ramon Sessions was also a replacement in the starting lineup, as Darren Collison was out with a quad injury. Sessions also took advantage of the start and recorded 15 points and six assists. Coming off the bench, Ray McCallum had 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) in 19 minutes. For the Pelicans, Anthony Davis was n't his normal self tonight. He struggled to post the monster line he's become accustomed to this season, as he shot only 4 - for - 12 from the field to finish with 14 points and nine rebounds. His output was well below his season averages of 26 points and 11 rebounds. Tyreke Evans played well on the other hand. He scored 22 points (10 - 17 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and added seven rebounds and five assists. The 22 points matched a season - high for Evans. Ryan Anderson was really the only other big contributor in the loss. He shot 7 - for - 14 from the field and 3 - for - 7 from beyond the arc to score 20 points. It was n't enough of a boost to beat a tough Sacramento team though. The Kings' next game will be on the road against the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, while the Pelicans will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Friday.

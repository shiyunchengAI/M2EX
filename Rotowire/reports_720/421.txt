The Phoenix Suns (8 - 9) avoided losing their fifth straight by beating the Toronto Raptors (11 - 7) by a score of 107 - 102, Sunday, in Toronto. The loss also ended Toronto's four game winning streak. Both teams were missing their starting centers as Jonas Valanciunas (hand) and Tyson Chandler (knee) were both out. The Suns led 81 - 72 heading into the fourth but a late surge from Toronto brought them within buzzer - beater range, although this night, the second of a back - to - back, they could not get it done. DeMar DeRozan had a great game for the Raptors, scoring a season high 29 points on 11 - 20 shooting, along with seven assists and three rebounds in 37 minutes. Kyle Lowry continued his strong play as well, with 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. DeMarre Carroll posted 20 points on 8 - 13 shooting, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals. Toronto will ultimately need more help from the bench if they want to have any great success this season, DeRozan, Lowry and Carroll can not do it alone, although Valanciunas has been missed. Phoenix had three bench players score 15 or more points; quite the contrary to Torontos who had no bench players score in double digits. Mirza Teletovic was raining threes, shooting 6 - 7 from deep and finishing with 20 points, two rebounds and one assist, in only 18 minutes off the bench. T.J. Warren posted a double double with 15 points and 11 rebounds on 7 - 13 shooting, in 29 minutes off the bench. Eric Bledsoe led the way for the Suns with a big 20 points, 11 assists, five rebounds and three blocked shots, including one potentially game - saving block in the last few seconds. Phoenix will be playing in Brooklyn Tuesday for the second game of their current six game road trip. Toronto will be in Atlanta Wednesday for a big Eastern Conference match up.

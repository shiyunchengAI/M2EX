The Toronto Raptors (44 - 20) took down the Miami Heat (38 - 28) in overtime Saturday, winning 112 - 104 in a matchup that should have major implications for the Eastern Conference playoff picture. Guard DeMar DeRozan had arguably his strongest performance of the season, scoring 38 points while also pulling down 10 rebounds and dishing out seven assists. The All-Star got to the free - throw line 15 times in the contest, converting on 12 of those attempts. Center Jonas Valanciunas also posted a double - double, scoring 20 and pulling down 10 boards. The Raptors held the Heat to just 38 percent shooting from the field in a strong team defensive performance. Toronto now sits two games back from Cleveland for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. Recent acquisition Joe Johnson led the Heat with 28 points, his highest - scoring performance in a Miami uniform. With stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh both sidelined, the Heat made due with what they had, finding buckets in unusual places. Forward Luol Deng also chipped in 20 points, while standout center Hassan Whiteside posted 13 from the bench. The Heat are now a full game behind the Boston Celtics for third in the East. The Heat will play the Nuggets on Monday, while the Raptors will take on the Bulls.

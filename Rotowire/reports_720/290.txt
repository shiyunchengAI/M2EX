The Golden State Warriors (53 - 13) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (17 - 49) 108 - 105 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland. While the Lakers have already been eliminated from the playoffs, this win pushes the Warriors to six and a half games ahead of the Memphis Grizzlies, who sit second in the Western Conference standings. The Warriors have now won two games in a row and eight of their last ten, as they comfortably hold their lead in the West. Despite taking the loss, the Lakers finised with a 45 - 37 rebounding advantage and shot an impressive 50 percent from the three - point line. The Warriors' superstar duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson did it again Monday. Thompson went 10 - for - 22 from the field and 3 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points, while also adding three rebounds. Thompson has been scoring at a high rate lately, as he's averaging 25 points over his last five games. Curry, on the other hand, finished with 26 points (5 - 14 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT), nine assists and three steals in 33 minutes. He's put in two solid performances in a row, combining for 44 points, 20 assists and six steals in his last two outings. Also playing a big factor in the win was Draymond Green, as he recorded 16 points (7 - 14 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), to go along with eight rebounds and a game - high of five steals. He's been a force defensively for the Warriors, with this marking his second game in a row with five steals. Harrison Barnes chipped in with 11 points (3 - 8 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) as well. The Lakers saw a true team - effort in the loss, with six players reaching double figures in points. Jordan Clarkson was impressive, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding six rebounds and a pair of steals in just 25 minutes. He has shot below 35 percent from the field in each of his last three games, so it was good to see him get pointed back in the right direction Monday. Wayne Ellington posted 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) of his own in 30 minutes. It was some nice production from the guard, with this being his highest scoring performance since the beginning of February. Notching a double - double, Jordan Hill finished with 15 points (6 - 14 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and 12 rebounds. The Lakers also saw some good contributions off the bench. Jeremy Lin had 15 points (3 - 8 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT) and four assists, while Carlos Boozer added 10 points (5 - 12 FG) and nine rebounds. The Warriors' next game will be at home against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, while the Lakers will be at home against the Utah Jazz on Thursday.

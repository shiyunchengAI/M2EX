On Friday, newly acquired veteran Pau Gasol delivered his biggest performance in a Spurs uniform. Gasol scored 21 points and had nine rebounds to go along with six assists, two blocks, and a steal. The veteran forward shot 10 - of - 16, helping to make up for the off night experienced by star wing Kawhi Leonard. Leonard shot just 5 - of - 18 on the night, but did record four three - pointers and four steals. Big man LaMarcus Aldridge had a double - double, scoring 14 points and hauling in 12 rebounds. The Pistons, meanwhile, were carried by All-Star center Andre Drummond. Drummond led the team with 20 points and pulled down a whopping 17 rebounds. The performance did not stop there, however, as the center also impressed with his shooting splits. Drummond went 8 - of - 10 from the field including a rare three - pointer, and also saw an unusual perfect night from the free - throw line.

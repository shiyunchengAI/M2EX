Thursday marked the sixth game this season that Tobias Harris played as a reserve, and it was yet another great performance off the bench for the 6 - foot - 8 forward. Harris recorded a game - high 25 points in Thursday's victory over the Hornets, and with that, he is now averaging 22 points per game over his six as a reserve this year. On top of that, he's also been doing work on the glass, as while he managed to record just two rebounds Thursday, he is still averaging 7 per game off the bench. And with Harris' move to the bench, Jon Leuer has been thrust into the starting lineup and has matched his production as a reserve, with the big man out of Wisconsin averaging 11 points on 50 percent shooting from the field as a starter after averaging 11 points per game in his former role off the bench.

The Cavaliers were unable to overcome the absence of LeBron James, falling to the Thunder 103 - 94 on Thursday night. James, who sat out with soreness in his knee, is 14 - 4 against Kevin Durant in his career, but could do nothing but watch from the sidelines as Durant and Russell Westbrook stifled a late run by the Cavaliers, whose eight - game winning streak was snapped. The Thunder opened up a 20 - point lead early in the fourth quarter, courtesy of an 80 spree spurred by three - pointers by Reggie Jackson and Anthony Morrow. However, the Cavaliers responded, as a Matthew Dellavedova-led run brought Cleveland back to within four with just under two minutes to play. Following a timeout, the Thunder were able to regroup, as Kevin Durant scored Oklahoma City’s final eight points to put the game away. Durant finished with 19 points, six rebounds and five assists, converting 6 - of - 14 field goals. He continues to be on a strict 30 - minute limit, though it’s likely to be lifted in the near future. Westbrook led the way with 26 points (12 - 24 FG), eight assists and seven rebounds, while Reggie Jackson added 13 points off the bench. Serge Ibaka had just seven points and no rebounds before fouling out in 26 minutes. Cleveland, which struggled to find quality shots without James, shot a paltry 37 percent from the floor but registered 30 free throw attempts, compared to Oklahoma City’s 22. Irving had a team - high 20 points (7 - 21 FG) to go with six assists, and Kevin Love added 18 points and 16 rebounds. Dellavedova, who drew the start in place of James, finished with 14 points, including four three - pointers. Both teams are on the first night of a back - to - back set. Cleveland heads to New Orleans to take on Anthony Davis and the Pelicans, while the Thunder play at Minnesota.

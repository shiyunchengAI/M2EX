The San Antonio Spurs (47 - 26) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (50 - 24) 103 - 89 Sunday at the AT & T Center in a clash of two of the best teams in the Western Conference San Antonio had the lead for the entirety of Sunday's game, but Memphis hung close until the fourth quarter. Kawhi Leonard scored the Spurs' first 15 points of the fourth to help break the game open. Leonard finished with a game - high 25 points and 10 rebounds in 33 minutes of action. While the Spurs are peaking at the right time of the season, the Grizzlies' recent struggles are starting to become a concern. The Grizzlies have dropped three straight to top - level competition by an average margin of 20 points. Houston has now overtaken Memphis for the second seed in the West. Memphis's fourth quarter implosion led to its third loss in a row. The Grizzlies have only had one other stretch with more consecutive losses, which was a four game skid back in December. Zach Randolph broke out his mini - slump Sunday, however, with 20 points and 13 boards in 33 minutes. The Grizzlies will look to bounce back Monday when they host the Kings. San Antonio is looking more and more like its championship team from a year ago. Sunday was another all - around effort from the Spurs, who had a plus - 14 rebounding margin and shot 50 percent from the floor as a team. Tony Parker had 17 points and six assists and Tiago Splitter was solid again with 15 points and eight rebounds. The Spurs will return to action Tuesday when they take on the Heat in Miami in a rematch of the last two finals.

The New York Knicks defeated the host Los Angeles Lakers, 118 - 112, at Staples Center on Sunday. The Knicks (14 - 10) received the bulk of their offense from Derrick Rose and Kristaps Porzingis, as both made up for a rough shooting night from Carmelo Anthony. The neck - and - neck game never had one team clearly pulling away from the other, as a series of lead changes occurred in the third quarter. However, the Knicks came away with a nine - point lead to close out the third and went on to take charge of the fourth quarter as well. Porzingis was effective on both ends of the floor, scoring 26 points, to go along with 12 rebounds, two assists and seven blocks on 8 - of - 15 shooting. Rose (back) returned to action in Sunday's road contest and scored 25 points on 12 - of - 16 shooting, while Anthony struggled to find a rhythm on his way to 13 points on 16 shots. Brandon Jennings registered 23 minutes in his return to the bench, but was still effective with 19 points, three rebounds and four assists. Luol Deng and Louis Williams pulled the weight in the scoring department for Los Angeles (10 - 16), while D'Angelo Russell looked a bit off in his return to the starting lineup as well. Deng pitched in 22 points, five rebounds, two assists and two steals on 8 - of - 13 shooting. Williams scored 24 points on 13 shots across 26 minutes. It was Williams' fifth straight game scoring at least 24 points, which also includes three games with at least 30 points. The Lakers will look to end their five - game losing streak when they face the Sacramento Kings in the second game of a back - to - back Monday, while the Knicks visit the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday.

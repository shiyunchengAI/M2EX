The New Orleans Pelicans (15 - 14) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (18 - 13) 97 - 90 on Friday. New Orleans has won four of their last six. While they are currently fighting for one of the last playoff spots in the Western Conference, the Pelicans are still finding out how to win every night. They have the talent to beat the best teams in the West, but the Pelicans lack the experience and chemistry to play as consistently from game to game as the top eight teams in the conference. Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson both put up a game - high 22 points. Davis also posted 12 rebounds and five blocks in 38 minutes, while Anderson also posted seven rebounds and two three - pointers in 33 minutes off the bench. New Orleans will have another tough matchup Saturday when they travel to Chicago to take on the Bulls. San Antonio has been trying to navigate one of the more treacherous parts of their schedule while resting players nightly to try and make sure they're healthy when the real games begin in the playoffs. As a result, they've lost six of their last seven games. Tony Parker returned for the last two games but did not play Friday, and it's unlcear whether he was simply being rested on the second game of a back - to - back set or if he aggravated his hamstring injury. Cory Joseph earned the start in his place. Kawhi Leonard (hand) continues to sit out indefinitely, giving Kyle Anderson another spot start at small forward. After sitting out Thursday's game with an illness, Boris Diaw was available to play Friday. He put up 10 points and six rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench. The Spurs gave up 20 easy points off of 17 turnovers, pointing to their greatest weakness Friday and the likely reason why they lost the game. San Antonio will host the Houston Rockets on Sunday.

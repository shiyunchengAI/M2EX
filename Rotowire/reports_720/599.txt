The Chicago Bulls defeated the Orlando Magic 112 - 80 at United Center on Monday. The Bulls' (4 - 3) second - half defense propelled them toward a blowout win at home over the Magic (3 - 4). The contest was close in the first half, with Orlando keeping themselves within striking distance of the Chicago lead. Evan Fournier and Aaron Gordon led the Magic in the second quarter after falling behind early, and they entered the half with a nine - point deficit. The second half was a different story, however, as the Magic posted just 11 points in the third quarter and 17 points in the final period. Chicago was able to pull away with relative ease after Orlando went scoreless from the 10:12 mark to the 5:13 mark in the third quarter. While shooting inside the arc went swimmingly for the Bulls, who hit 47 percent of their attempts from the field as a unit, three - point shooting did not go nearly as well. Chicago shot just 16 percent from behind the arc on 3 - of - 19 shooting. The three point shooting was going surprisingly well up until Monday, given the trio of Rajon Rondo, Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade's career marks not being among the elite in the NBA. Butler led the way for Chicago and finished with 20 points, seven assists and five rebounds, while Wade added 16 points, four assists and three boards. Gordon finished with 15 points for the Magic, to go along with four assists and four rebounds. The bench was of little help to the starters, as Mario Hezonja's nine points led the reserves. Orlando shot just 39 percent from the field as a team, and the long scoring drought in the third quarter proved to be all the Bulls needed to come away with a win. Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Bulls travel to Atlanta to take on the Hawks, while the Magic return home to host the Minnesota Timberwolves.

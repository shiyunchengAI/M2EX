The Detroit Pistons (18 - 15) rolled over the Minnesota Timberwolves (12 - 21) 115 - 90 on Thursday night. The Timberwolves started off the game up by seven points after the first quarter, but it was all downhill after that. In fact, the Pistons outscored the Wolves 100 - 68 over the final 36 minutes. The game got to an 11 - point deficit in the fourth, but the Pistons starters came in and went on a 140 run to put the game way out of hand. The rebounding was the big difference, as Detroit snatched down 52 to Minnesota's 36 boards. Minnesota has been struggling recently and this game showed why. They were dominated in the second and fourth quarters, which are the decisive quarters in any NBA game. They were actually outscored by 32 points combined in those two quarters. Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Shabazz Muhammad all played well, but no one else did anything. In fact, those three combined for 58 points with no other player scoring in double - figures. Towns was their best player, as he tallied 23 points and nine rebounds in the loss. The Timberwolves will look to bounce - back in their next game on Saturday against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Pistons have been one of the best rebounding teams in the league this season and that carried them to a win here. Most notably, Andre Drummond brought down another 18 rebounds to compliment his 23 points. Reggie Jackson also played well in just 27 minutes of action, providing 19 points and nine assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also continued his breakout season, as he amassed 22 points, four rebounds, three assists and three steals as well. This is a dangerous team at home, as they are now 11 - 5 at the Palace. Detroit’s next game will be on Saturday against the Indiana Pacers.

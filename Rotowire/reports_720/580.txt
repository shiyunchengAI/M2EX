The Oklahoma City Thunder (27 - 12) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (12 - 27) 101 - 96 on Tuesday night. This was a major mismatch on paper, but this game was closer than expected. Minnesota actually made a huge run in the fourth quarter to nearly cap off a double - digit comeback. What killed Minnesota once again were it's starters, as they amassed just 41 points between the five of them. That's actually less points than Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook combined who scored 52 of their own. The Thunder have been one of the best teams in the NBA since December and that continued here. They got out to an early double - digit lead and never looked back after that. Westbrook and Durant once again carried the load, as they combined for 52 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists in the win. Enes Kanter continued his fantastic bench production, as he scored 18 points in less than 20 minutes of action. It's quite bizarre actually, considering Kanter is ranked as one of the 10 best big men in the NBA on a per - minute rate. They simply need to get him some more minutes if the Thunder want to get to their full potential. Oklahoma City's next game will be on Wednesday against the Dallas Mavericks. The Timberwolves are easily one of the worst home teams in the NBA, but they played well here. They are now just 5 - 17 at Target Center and it's a wonder why such a young team is so bad in their home arena. In any case, most of their youngsters played great here, as Shabazz Muhammad, Zach LaVine and Andrew Wiggins all scored at least 20 points. LaVine put in the most impressive line, as he accumulated 21 points, nine rebounds and four assists in one of his best games of the season. Minnesota will look to get out of this slump in their next game when they take on the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.

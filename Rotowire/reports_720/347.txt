The Boston Celtics (39 - 27) took care of the shorthanded Memphis Grizzlies (38 - 26) in a 116 - 96 win on Wednesday. This game appeared to be lopsided on paper and that proved to be the case on the floor. The Celtics really took it to the Grizzlies in the second half, as they outscored them 64 - 4`.The key for Boston was the defense, as they held Memphis to 38 percent shooting and drew 19 turnovers in the win. Memphis won their last game against the Cleveland Cavaliers in a similar circumstance, but this was the result that was much more likely with such a limited roster. Once again, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol missed this game and it clearly hampered the Grizzlies. JaMychal Green got the start for Randolph and double - doubled in a 17 - point, 13 - rebound performance. Jarrell Martin and Vince Carter both played well off the bench, as they went for 33 points combined, despite much of that coming in garbage time. Mario Chalmers tallied 11 points, five rebounds and five assists before leaving with what looked like a leg injury after 21 minutes of play. On deck for Memphis is a matchup with the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. Th Celtics came into this game as a double - digit favorite and didn’t disappoint. Seven players scored in double - figures for Boston, with 13 players playing in total. The team combined for 26 assists on 41 made shots.

The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the San Antonio Spurs 116 - 92 at Staples Center on Saturday. The Clippers (5 - 1) took advantage of a major scoring drought at the hand of the Spurs (5 - 2) from the 9:0 mark to the 3:0 point of the first quarter, where San Antonio was only able to salvage one basket during that period. The Clippers went on a scoring run anchored by Blake Griffin, who went on to score 16 points in the opening period. Los Angeles maintained their strong start throughout the second quarter, and entered the half with an 18 point lead. The Spurs were unable to cut into the lead in the second half, as the Clippers rallied behind impressive bench performances from Marreese Speights and Jamal Crawford. Griffin led the way for Los Angeles with 28 points, five rebounds and three assists, while Chris Paul almost notched a triple - double with nine points, eight rebounds and 10 assists. Speights and Crawford combined for 31 points on 10 - of - 18 shooting. San Antonio struggled with their shooting efficiency and finished just over 40 percent as a unit. LaMarcus Aldridge has the standout performance amongst his teammates with 19 points and six rebounds, while Kawhi Leonard has a quiet night with just 14 points, six boards and one assist. Once the blowout was too much for San Antonio, coach Gregg Popovich started to utilize the depth of his bench and rotated eight different players off the bench into the game. No one player on the Spurs played more than 28 minutes. Next up, the Clippers host the Detroit Pistons on Monday, while the Spurs get some time off before Spurs host the Rockets on Wednesday.

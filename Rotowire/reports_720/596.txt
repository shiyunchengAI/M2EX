Milwaukee has now won four of their last five games, while scoring at least 110 points in all of those wins. Giannis Antetokounmpo continues to develop as a point guard, as he is averaging about 22 points, nine rebounds and eight assists a game after this blowout win. Sacramento's “others” continue to struggle, as this is now the seventh - straight game in which no other starter aside from Cousins or Gay has scored more than 11 points. Milwaukee dominated in nearly every facet, as they outshot Sacramento from the field, three - point range and the free - throw line. In addition to that, they also won the rebounding and assisting margins, while also dominating the steals and blocks categories. The benches were used heavily in this lopsided game, as they combined for 120 points between the two teams.

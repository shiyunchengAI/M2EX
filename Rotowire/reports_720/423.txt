The Denver Nuggets defeated the Orlando Magic 125 - 112 Tuesday at Pepsi Center. It was a wire - to - wire victory for the Nuggets (17 - 23), who have now won two in a row after a five - game losing streak. They were led by a monster performance from big man Nikola Jokic, who posted a game - high 30 points on 13 - of - 19 shooting, 11 rebounds, five assists and three steals in 36 minutes. The performance was Jokic's first 30 - point game of the regular season and his third double - double in as many games. Emanuel Mudiay added a double - double of his own, recording 18 points and a game - high 13 assists in 37 minutes, while Kenneth Faried played a wildly efficient game offensively as the team's starting power forward, posting 20 points on 10 - of - 12 shooting from the field. Overall as a team, Denver had a field day shooting the ball, as the Nuggets finished Monday's game shooting 58 percent from the field. As for the Magic (17 - 26), they have now lost two games in a row and six of their last seven. They were once again led by point guard Elfrid Payton, who has now put together a great three - game stretch. After posting 20 points, 12 rebounds and four assists in Monday's contest, he is now averaging 22 points, 9 assists and 6 rebounds over his last three contests. Overall for Orlando, the problem was n't offense. They shot 50 percent from the field en route to posting their third straight total over 100 points and had seven different players score in double figures. Again, it was their lackluster defensive effort that made things too easy for the Nuggets offensively Monday. Up next, the Nuggets will look for their third straight win against the Lakers on Tuesday, while the Magic will look to turn things around in New Orleans on Wednesday.

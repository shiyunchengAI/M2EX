The San Antonio Spurs (14 - 5) edged the Memphis Grizzlies (15 - 4) 107 - 101 at FedEx Forum on Friday. Coming off an overtime loss to the Nets on Wednesday, San Antonio jumped out of the blocks and were never headed after Tony Parker got the first bucket of the night. Parker scored 14 points before leaving the game due to a hamstring strain, of which the severity is unknown at this point. Tim Duncan accumulated the fourth triple - double of his illustrious career, scoring 14 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 36 minutes. Duncan also added two blocks to his impressive stat line. Danny Green's hot streak continued, pouring in 16 points, including three three - pointers, bringing his recent tally to 17 made three - pointers in his last five games. The Spurs face off against the Timberwolves back home in San Antonio on Saturday. Marc Gasol pushed through the bone bruise on his knee to lead the Grizzlies in scoring, ending the game with 28 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks. He was ably assisted by Mike Conley, who had 23 points of his own, along with 10 assists. Tayshaun Prince turned back the clock, joining Gasol and Conley with 20 points, including hitting all four of his attempts from behind the three - point line. The Grizzlies had been undefeated at home before coming up against the Spurs, and have now lost two consecutive games for the first time this season. They will try to right the ship Sunday against the visiting Miami Heat.

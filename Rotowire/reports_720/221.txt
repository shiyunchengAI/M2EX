The Denver Nuggets defeated the Dallas Mavericks 117 - 107 at Pepsi Center on Monday. The wire - to - wire affair never saw one team pull away from the other, however, the control was mostly in favor of the Nuggets. The Mavericks (7 - 21) entered the game with an onslaught of injuries facing their lineup, including Dirk Nowitzki (achilles), Andrew Bogut (knee) and J.J. Barea (calf). All five Nuggets (12 - 16) starters finished in double figures scoring, led by Nikola Jokic and his 27 points. The impressive performance from Denver's power forward also fell just one assist shy of a big triple - double, as he finished with 15 rebounds and nine assists on 13 - of - 17 shooting. Jamal Murray saw 14 minutes of action after dealing with soreness, but only contributed three points on four shots. The injuries have derailed the season for the Mavericks, who will struggle to compete with even the mid - level opponents. The road struggle continues for Dallas as well, who have just one road win on the year. Deron Williams led the team with 23 points, to go along with rebound and eight assists. Harrison Barnes also contributed an efficient effort with 19 points on 9 - of - 15 shooting. Impressively, both teams shot above 50 percent as a unit, but the strong 53 percent effort from the Mavericks was overshadowed by the even more powerful 57 percent effort from the Nuggets. The Nuggets play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday, while the Mavericks visit the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

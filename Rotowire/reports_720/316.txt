The Chicago Bulls defeated the Washington Wizards 106 - 95 at United Center on Saturday. The Wizards came into this game extremely shorthanded and it was simply too much to overcome. While they held the lead for the majority of the first half, Chicago responded by running away late. A 90 run at the end of the third quarter is when it really opened up, as it was tied before that. Both teams really struggled shooting, as the Wizards shot 42 percent to the Bulls' 40 percent. Free-throw shooting carried Chicago, as they went 23 - of - 25 in the win. Fastbreak points was a huge difference as well, with the Bulls scoring 22 fastbreak points to the Wizards six. Washington (2 - 7) had to play this game without John Wall and Bradley Beal, which was simply too much production to overcome. Markieff Morris did all he could though, leading the team with 24 points and 15 rebounds. Marcin Gortat also recorded a double - double, totaling 18 points and 14 rebounds. Sheldon McClellan and Tomas Satoransky filled - in for Wall and Beal, combining for 27 points, six rebounds and 10 assists in pleasantly surprising performances. Washington will be off until Wednesday, when they take on the Philadelphia 76ers in a much needed favorable matchup. Chicago (6 - 4) has now won three of their last four after losing three - straight, so it appears they've steadied the ship. Jimmy Butler had one of the best games of his career, accumulating 37 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in the win. Robin Lopez finished with 10 points and 13 rebounds, despite going 5 - of - 16 from the field. Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade struggled with their shots as well, combining for 14 points on 5 - of - 23 shooting. Nikola Mirotic was huge off the bench, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 boards en route to a double - double. Chicago's next game will be on Tuesday, when they travel to play the Portland Trail Blazers.

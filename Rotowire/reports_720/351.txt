The Bulls (11 - 5) came away with a 99 - 90 win against the Nuggets (6 - 13) at United Center on Wednesday. With guards Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose struggling to find their shots, the Bulls turned to Pau Gasol, who posted season highs in both points (26) and rebounds (19) while adding four blocks over 36 minutes. The win helped the Bulls improve to 7 - 1 at home this season and moved them into a tie with the Pacers for second place in the Eastern Conference standings. The Nuggets managed to take a four - point lead into the fourth quarter after a 13 - 3 run to end the third, but Gasol was just too much in the final frame. Denver had an awful night shooting from the field, hitting 35 - of - 90 and got absolutely no production from any guards, who combined to score 11 points. Emmanuel Mudiay had the worst night with just four points on 2 - of - 12 shooting, though he did dish out seven assists. The lone bright spot for the Nuggets was Kenneth Faried, who has been working his way back from an ankle injury. Faried scored 14 points (7 - 10 FG, 0 - 2 FT) with eight rebounds and three assists over 28 minutes. The Bulls came away with the win, but lost a key contributor in the process after Nikola Mirotic was elbowed in the face in the first period and did not return. Mirotic played just five minutes before leaving, hitting a lone 3 - pointer to go along with three rebounds and a steal. With Mirotic gone for the game, coach Fred Hoiberg turned to Joakim Noah, who has looked more like his old self lately. Noah played a season - high 34 minutes, piling on 11 rebounds to go with his nine points and four blocks. Chicago returns to action Saturday in the third game of a four - game homestand against the Hornets; the Nuggets play the fourth of a five - game road trip Thursday against the Raptors.

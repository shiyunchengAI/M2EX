The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics 128 - 122 on Thursday at Quicken Loans Arena. The score indicates a closer game than it actually was, as after the Cavaliers (50) took a 17 - point lead headed into the final period, the Celtics (3 - 2) came roaring back to at least make the game interesting, but six points was as close as they were going to get. After being rather passive scoring - wise through the first four games of the regular season, LeBron James exploded going for a game - high 30 points on top of 12 assists and seven rebounds in 36 minutes. The other two members of Cleveland's big three also put together big nights, with Kevin Love recording 26 points and eight rebounds, as he continues his hot start to the season, and Kyrie Irving scoring 23 points of his own. As a team, the Cavaliers managed to do plenty of damage from behind the arc — where they shot 41 percent from — and the free throw line — where they shot an incredible 37 shots from, making 32 of them. Boston, on the other hand, came into this game missing both Jae Crowder (ankle) and Al Horford (concussion) and were carried by their starting backcourt consisting of Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley. Thomas recorded a game - high 30 points while scoring nearly half of his points from the free throw line, as he shot 14 - of - 14 from the charity stripe. The rest of his Boston teammates struggled getting to the line, however, as they shot just 5 - of - 8 from the stripe over the course of Thursday's game. Bradley was n't too far behind, recording a double - double of 26 points and 10 rebounds over 39 minutes. It was rookie Jaylen Brown, however, who had the game's breakout performance, scoring a career - high 19 points and grabbing five rebounds after getting the start in place of the injured Crowder. Up next, the Cavaliers will head to Philadelphia on Saturday to take on the 76ers, while the Celtics will have off until Sunday when they will take on the Nuggets.

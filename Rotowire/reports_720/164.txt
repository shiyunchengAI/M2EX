Gordon Hayward and Rudy Gobert stepped up their play after Rodney Hood left the game with a right hamstring injury, and the sharp shooting and rebounding on display by both starters were able to keep the Rockets comeback attempts at bay. Hayward led the Jazz in scoring with 31 points, to go along with seven assists and five rebound. Hayward also buried a trio of three pointers, in addition to finishing 12 - of - 13 from the free throw line. Gobert notched his 11th triple - double of the season, which ties him with Andre Drummond for seventh in the NBA. The Jazz center scored 16 points and grabbed 14 rebounds in the win. Four of the 14 boards that Gobert hauled in came on the offensive end of the floor, as he dominated his matchup with Clint Capela. James Harden led the way for the Rockets with 26 points, seven assists and five rebounds on 8 - of - 23 shooting.

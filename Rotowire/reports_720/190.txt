The Los Angeles Clippers (10) defeated the Houston Rockets (0 - 1) 117 - 101 in Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals on Monday. Blake Griffin not only dropped a triple - double, but also saw some time at point guard on offense in the fourth quarter for the Clippers, who were without their leader Chris Paul. He hurt his hamstring in the miraculous Game 7 of Los Angeles' win over the San Antonio Spurs. On Monday they turned their attention to a different Texas team but wound up with the same result. Griffin's triple - double marks his third of the postseason, no other player has recorded one triple - double so far. DeAndre Jordan did a bang up job on the inside. He finished with 10 points, 13 rebounds, five assists, four blocks, two steals and just two late fouls when the game was already seemingly out of hand for the Rockets. Austin Rivers, who started in place on Paul, finished with 17 points and four steals in 28 minutes. Jamal Crawford quietly had a good game with 21 points, five boards, four assists and two steals. However, like many players in this game, was bit by the turnover bug. Crawford had six of his teams 21 turnovers. The Rockets had a 13 - point in the first lead but could n't hold on, even without Paul in the opposing lineup. Houston's lead shrank to just four points at halftime. They kept it close for a little while but Los Angeles was able to skip away slowly and won the game going away. With plenty of hack - a - whoever to go around in this one, the Clippers were able to win both the third and fourth quarters by 10 points each, and now hold a 10 lead in the series to go along with homecourt advantage. James Harden learned Monday that Stephen Curry won the MVP. He had a solid game with 20 points, 12 assists, five rebounds and four steals. Unfortunately for the Rockets, he also had nine costly turnovers.

Over those four games, he's averaging 19 points and 4 rebounds. Getting the start at shooting guard with the Nuggets using a small lineup due to Jusuf Nurkic's injury, Randy Foye was very successful in extended minutes. He went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 10 from the three - point line to score 19 points, to go along with two steals in 29 minutes. It marked just the fourth time this season he reached double figures in points, so it was a nice surprise for the Nuggets. Coming off the bench, Will Barton continued with his impressive stretch.

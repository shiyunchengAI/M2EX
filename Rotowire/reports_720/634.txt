The Sacramento Kings defeated the Brooklyn Nets 122 - 105 at Golden 1 Center on Sunday. The Kings (7 - 10) ran away with their seventh win of the season in the third quarter against the Nets (4 - 12). After Brooklyn took a four point lead into the second quarter, the Kings bounced back and went into the half down just one point. DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay went to work in the third quarter on both ends of the floor, where the Kings outscored the Nets 34 - 18 and did not have to look back the rest of the contest. The Nets only managed three points in the last four minutes of that third quarter, while the Kings picked up the pace in transition and capped off a double digit scoring run. Cousins led the way with 37 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, four steals and one block, while Rudy Gay poured in 22 points of his own, to go along with eight boards and eight assists. Cousins was dominant from every inch of the floor, and that included an impressive 4 - of - 5 from behind the arc and 7 - of - 9 from the free throw line. The Nets had no response once Cousins got going, and the floor being spaced favored Rudy Gay to work off the dribble. Four Nets starters finished in double figures including Sean Kilpatrick, who led the Nets in that department with 22 points, to go along with five rebounds and three assists. Kilpatrick and Isaiah Whitehead, the Seton Hall product, were the only two players on the Nets to finish with a positive plus - minus. The Kings play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Washington Wizards on Monday, while the Nets host the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.

The Oklahoma City Thunder (24 - 10) routed the Hornets (17 - 16) in Charlotte on Saturday, 109 - 90. The Thunder have been on a tear of late, picking up 13 of their last 15 games. After a mediocre start, OKC has established themselves comfortably as the third - ranked team in the Western Conference, and have slowly been gaining on the second seed San Antonio Spurs, who currently rank dead last in strength of schedule. 2014 MVP Kevin Durant led the way for the Thunder with a 29 - point scoring performance. Durant paired the impressive points total with 11 rebounds and four blocked shots, contributing to the Thunder's impressive 15 total blocks. All-NBA point guard Russell Westbrook showcased his skill too, posting a well - rounded stat line of 16 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. The dynamic duo of Durant and Westbrook has been elecrtic this season, as both players rank in the top four in the league in scoring. The Hornets, meanwhile, got off to a blazing hot start this season but have slowed down recently. Charlotte is now just 7 - 9 in the month of December and have dropped three straight games. Star point guard Kemba Walker, however, has not wavered in the face of the losing streak. Walker delivered a dominant 32 points, which he coupled with three steals on the defensive end. Walker's effort was not enough, however, as the team was held to just 35 percent shooting from the field on the night. OKC will hope to continue playing winning basketball as they prepare to take on the Sacramento Kings on Monday. Charlotte, on the other hand, will face a tough challenge as they take to the road against the 30 - 2 Golden State Warriors on Monday.

The New Orleans Pelicans (40 - 34) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (20 - 54) 113 - 92 on Wednesday. Anthony Davis put on another show and the Lakers did n't have an answer for him. He had 20 points, seven rebounds, six assists, four blocks and one steal in 35 minutes. He got some big bench contributions from Ryan Anderson and Norris Cole, who each scored 17 points. Tyreke Evans has continued to relish his role as the Pelican's point guard, he had 16 points and eight assists with zero turnovers in 28 minutes. He's put up averages of 20 points and 8 assists over his last five games. New Orleans has won three straight and hope to dethrone the Oklahoma City Thunder for the final playoff spots in the Western Conference. The Lakers got a solid performance from Jordan Clarkson but got little help from teammates, as they currently do n't have a go - to guy. Clarkson led Los Angeles with 18 points and 10 assists to go along with seven rebounds in 31 minutes. The Lakers have an eye on the future as the season rolls to an end in just a couple weeks. The Lakers will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday, as the Pelicans will play in Sacramento against the Kings.

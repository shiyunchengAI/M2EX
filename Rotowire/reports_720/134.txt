The Los Angeles Lakers (8 - 16) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (5 - 18) 100 - 94 on Sunday. Los Angeles has strung together three straight wins with their new starting lineup. Ironically enough, most of their success can be pointed to the improved play of their bench since Jeremy Lin and Carlos Boozer were moved into reserve roles. Taking Boozer and Lin out of the starting lineup allows Kobe Bryant to operate unecumbered as the loan dominant offensive player in the starting lineup while giving Lin and Boozer possessions off the bench that do n't require Bryant to force his touches. Boozer led the Lakers on Sunday with a bygone double - double of 22 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes. The Lakers will look to continue their recent success when they take on the woeful Indiana Pacers on Monday. Bryant's 26 points vaulted him over Michael Jordan in career points to land at third all - time for the NBA scoring record. Minnesota has lost two straight games, but wins and losses are no longer the focus of the Timberwolves' season as president Flip Saunders told the media this week that the team's focus is now on rebuilding for the future, a path Saunders did not plan to walk down this season. However, with Ricky Rubio (ankle), Kevin Martin (wrist) and Nikola Pekovic (wrist) all expected to miss as much as another month of action, Minnesota's hopes of competing for a playoff spot this season were dashed. They'll embark on a two - game road trip Tuesday in Washington against the Wizards.

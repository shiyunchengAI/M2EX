The Utah Jazz defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 100 - 92, Tuesday at Vivint Smart Home Arena. LeBron James of the Cavaliers (28 - 9) came into Salt Lake City on Tuesday having not won there since 2010. That losing streak will extend at least one more year as the Jazz (24 - 16) managed to lead from wire - to - wire in what was a terrific defensive effort against an explosive Cleveland team. Offensively, though, it was Gordon Hayward who shined with a very efficient offensive performance, scoring a team - high 28 points on 10 - of - 12 shooting from the field and 4 - of - 5 shooting from behind the arc. Alongside Hayward, each of the other four Utah starters managed to score in double figures, and the starting unit accounted for 82 of the team's 100 points. For Cleveland, a stingy Jazz defense led to an uncharacteristically poor shooting night, as they finished shooting just 37 percent from the field and 29 percent from behind the arc. Two of the Cavaliers' big three were solid Tuesday, with James leading the way with 29 points, six rebounds, five assists and four steals, while Kyrie Irving scored 20 points of his own. Kevin Love, however, struggled, finishing with just 12 points and nine rebounds on a poor 4 - of - 14 shooting from the field. The loss ended what was a three - game road winning streak for the Cavaliers. Up next, the Jazz will look to build on Tuesday's victory on Thursday against the Pistons, while the Cavaliers will look to bounce back against the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

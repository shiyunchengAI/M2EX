The San Antonio Spurs (30 - 17) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (19 - 27) 95 - 86 on Wednesday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio. The Spurs got a really quick start in this game, out - scoring the Hornets 55 - 38 in the first half alone. While they struggled to get anything going in the third quarter, the Spurs did enough damage in the first two, that they were still able to coast to the victory. The Spurs were also able to out - rebound the Hornets 49 - 43, giving them an even greater advantage over the Hornets. The Spurs back court of Tony Parker and Danny Green did most of the damage for the Spurs in this one. Parker went 7 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 17 points, while also adding five assists in 27 minutes. He had a very poor shooting performance (3 - 13 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt) in Sunday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks, so it was good to see him get back over 50 percent for his shooting percentage Wednesday. Green on the other hand finished with 16 points (6 - 11 FG, 4 - 8 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT), five rebounds, two steals and three blocked shots in 26 minutes. It was his first time reaching double - digit points in his last five games, as he's been struggling with his shot. Tim Duncan notched a double - double with 12 points, 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. It was his second straight double - double, as he's combined for 32 points and 25 rebounds in those two matchups. Al Jefferson and Gerald Henderson did everything they could to keep the Hornets close in this game. Jefferson went 8 - for - 12 from the field to score 17 points, while also adding 16 rebounds. He's now averaging 17 points and 8 rebounds on the season. Henderson on the other hand recorded 18 points (6 - 17 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), three assists and two blocked shots. Despite averaging 11 points so far this season, it was the second game in a row with 14 or more points. In only 25 minutes, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist went 7 - for - 13 from the field to score 14 points. He's now averaging 13 points over his last three games.

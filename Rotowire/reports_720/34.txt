The New York Knicks (14 - 54) fell to the Minnesota Timberwolves (15 - 53), 95 - 92, in overtime on Thursday at Madison Square Garden. The records of these two teams entering this contest belies how entertaining it was. The fourth quarter featured ties or lead changes on seemingly every possession and neither team ever led by more than two points in the period. Alexey Shved hit two clutch free throws late in the game to send it to overtime. Zach LaVine's six points in overtime made the difference, however, as the Timberwolves were able to edge out the Knicks. Minnesota was playing the second half of a back - to - back Thursday and was left with just eight healthy bodies at its disposal, including a D-League callup. Sean Kilpatrick was signed to a 10 - day contract Thursday and logged 10 minutes in this game as Kevin Garnett, Justin Hamilton, Gary Neal, Ricky Rubio, and Nikola Pekovic were not in uniform. Chase Budinger played 43 minutes off the bench and amassed 10 points, six rebounds, and four steals. Zach LaVine got the start at point guard and finished with 20 points, seven rebounds, and four assists over 37 minutes. The Timberwolves will have a few days off to get healthy before returning to action Sunday against Charlotte. New York fell just shy of notching its second straight overtime victory this week. Alexey Shved and Langston Galloway led the way with 20 and 21 points respectively. The Knicks have a quick turnaround after this game with a matchup in Philadelphia on the slate for Friday.

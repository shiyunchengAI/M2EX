The Atlanta Hawks (19 - 7) defeated the Houston Rockets (19 - 7) 104 - 97 on Saturday. Atlanta extended their win streak to three games. Kyle Korver led the way on offense with a game - high 22 points in 38 minutes. Dennis Schroder got a second straight spot start at point guard with Jeff Teague (hamstring) out again. Schroder put up eight points, six rebounds and six assists in 30 minutes. The Hawks shot 51 percent from the field while holding the Rockets to 40 percent shooting from the field. Atlanta will finish up their road trip on Monday against the Dallas Mavericks. Houston has dropped two straight as they work to find a balance following Dwight Howard's return to action. Howard has been playing great, but after the Rockets found great success during his absence, there can be an adjustment period when working a high - usage player like Howard back into the groove. Harden scored 18 points to go with a career - high 14 assists in 39 minutes. The Rockets will host the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday.

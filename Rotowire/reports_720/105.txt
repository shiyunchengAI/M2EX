The Bucks (2 - 4) got 18 points from rookie Jabari Parker, but it wasn’t enough to hold off the Pistons in Detroit on Friday. Milwaukee fell 98 - 95 for its second consecutive defeat after losing to the Bulls on Wednesday. The Bucks, who shot 47 percent from the floor and 25 percent (5 - of - 20) from three, trailed by four entering the fourth quarter but were never able to completely erase the lead. A Parker steal and dunk trimmed the deficit to two with 1:28 to play, but Greg Monroe responded with a basket on the other end. Then, following a Brandon Knight layup, Josh Smith rebounded a Kentavious Caldwell-Pope airball and laid it in, pushing the lead back to four. Caron Butler would go on to close the game out at the free throw line. For the second straight game, the Bucks got production from a number of sources, as 10 players saw double - digit minutes. Leading scorer Brandon Knight had 17 points, nine assists and six rebounds, joining Parker as the only Bucks in double - figures. Larry Sanders had seven points and five rebounds in 25 minutes, while Kendall Marshall, who entered the starting lineup in place of Jared Dudley, added three points and four assists. Giannis Antetokounmpo contributed nine points off the bench, as did Dudley. Detroit had six players in double - figures, led by 19 points from Caldwell-Pope. Brandon Jennings added 15 points, including four three - pointers, and Andre Drummond had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Josh Smith continued to struggle from the floor, shooting 5 - of - 14 (4 - 10 FT) en route to 14 points. Milwaukee, which out - rebounded Chicago by eight on Wednesday, grabbed 35 rebounds, compared to Detroit’s 40. Looking ahead, the Bucks return home to host the Grizzlies on Saturday. Detroit hosts the Jazz on Sunday evening.

The Detroit Pistons (23 - 19) defeated the Houston Rockets (22 - 22) 123 - 114 on Wednesday, despite a nightmare free - throw game from Andre Drummond. Drummond missed 23 foul shots, going 13 for 36 from the free - throw line to set an NBA record for most missed free throws in a game. The Pistons shot 59 foul shots to the Rockets' 18. Detroit outscored Houston, 71 - 58, in the first and fourth quarters, and it really was n't close aside from a small stretch in the third quarter when the Rockets decided to go to a hack - a - Drummond strategy.This was the first time Detroit has won in Houston since 2005. All five Pistons starters scored in double - figures. Up next for the Pistons is a date with the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday. James Harden carried the Rockets on his back with a triple - double, finishing with 33 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists. Dwight Howard suffered an ankle injury in the opening minutes. Trevor Ariza continued to struggle, as he went just 1 - for - 8 from the field to tally three points, four rebounds and one assist in another lackluster performance. Houston will look to bounce back in their next game on Friday against the Milwaukee Bucks.

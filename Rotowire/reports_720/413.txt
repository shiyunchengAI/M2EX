The Toronto Raptors (19 - 12) beat the Milwaukee Bucks (12 - 19) 111 - 90 on Saturday. Toronto earned a much - needed win in Milwaukee, as they managed to dominate on both sides of the ball. Headed into the matchup, the Raptors had lost three of their previous five matchups. Center Bismack Biyombo helped lead the comeback win, offering up 14 points, 12 rebounds, and four blocks on the night. Biyombo has been a force while filling in for injured starter Jonas Valancianus. The double - double comes as a follow - up to a dominant 20 - rebound performance. For the Bucks, defense appeared to be the main issue, as their opponents were able to knock down a highly efficient 52 percent of their shots. Shooting woes, too, contributed to the loss, as the Bucks shot just 42 percent from the field. Starters Michael Carter-Williams and Jabari Parker combined for an abysmal 6 - of - 25 shooting performance. Guard Khris Middleton, however, was able to get it going, hitting five three - pointers and posting 20 points. The Raptors are jocking for position near the top of the Eastern Conference. Their next contest will be on Monday in Chicago. The Bucks, meanwhile, will travel to Dallas for their next contest, also taking place on Monday.

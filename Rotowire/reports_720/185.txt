The Los Angeles Clippers (20) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (0 - 3) 118 - 111 on Friday. Blake Griffin scored a game - high 39 points to pace the Clippers, and proving that everyone in the NBA is shooting three - pointers these days, Griffin also connected on both of his three - point attempts. Jamal Crawford added 22 points off the bench, but the Clippers barely pulled out the win against the struggling Lakers. Kobe Bryant is doing his best to prove his doubters wrong. He finished with 21 points and seven assists in 35 minutes. Jeremy Lin had his breakout game with the Lakers after having struggled through the first two games of the season. He finished with 17 points and nine assists in 35 minutes. Jordan Hill scored a team - high 23 points, making a series of jumpers that are generally perceived to be out of his range. The Lakers showed a lot of fight in Friday's game, and where there seemed to be only despair following their first two blowout losses, the Lakers played well enough to offer some hope for their prospects this season if everything goes right and they stay healthy. The Clippers' next game is at home Sunday against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers will complete their back - to - back set on the road Saturday against the Golden State Warriors.

The Portland Trail Blazers (15 - 4) defeated the Indiana Pacers (7 - 12) 88 - 82 on Thursday. Portland is on a three - game win streak and have taken 12 of their last 13 games, giving up their only loss in that stretch to the Memphis Grizzlies. Neither team could find the bottom of the net Thursday, with both squads shooting under 40 percent from the field and below 30 percent from three - point range. Damian Lillard scored a game - high 23 points, while LaMarcus Aldridge posted a double - double of 18 points and 13 rebounds. The Blazers will embark on a five - game road trip that begins Sunday against the New York Knicks. Indiana moved fill - in starter Donald Sloan to a bench role and installed Rodney Stuckey as the starter at point guard so that they could move Chris Copeland's shooting into the starting lineup on the wing. Copeland did n't fulfill his promise Thurdsday, shooting just 2 - of - 9 from the field in 20 minutes. Stuckey put up 16 points and five assists in 29 minutes, and Sloan fell completely out of the rotation, failing to see a single minute off the bench. George Hill remains sidelined with a knee bruise and hamstring injury but hopes to return sometime in mid - December. The Pacers will wrap up their current four - game road trip in Sacramento on Friday against Kings.

The Dallas Mavericks (7 - 3) took down the Minnesota Timberwolves (2 - 7) in impressive fashion 131 - 117 on Saturday at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The Mavericks are simply on a roll right now, and seem to be hitting their stride early on in this 2014 season. On Saturday, they got the definition of a "team win", with eight players scoring in double figures, and Monta Ellis leading the charge with 30 points (11 - 21 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT). While Ellis played 35 minutes, he was the only starter to see more than 29 minutes, as Dirk Nowitzki played just 23 and Tyson Chandler played only 24. Dallas was up by 19 at halftime, so they were able to rest some key players and get the reserves some additional playing time. Al-Farouq Aminu had an impressive night off the bench with 10 points (5 - 7 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt), six rebounds, three steals, two blocks and one assist in 23 minutes. The Mavericks will now head to Charlotte to take on the Hornets on Monday night. For the Timberwolves, we saw them drop their fifth straight on Saturday, and each loss has been by at least nine points. They have n't been the same team without Ricky Rubio (ankle), and the minutes were spread out in a big way on Saturday night. A total of 11 players played, and everyone was out there for at least 12 minutes. Interestingly, Nikola Pekovic was the one who played just 12 minutes, scoring only two points (0 - 2 FG, 2 - 2 FT) to go with five rebounds and one assist. One of the few bright spots for Minnesota was Kevin Martin, who scored 34 points (12 - 17 FG, 4 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) to go with three rebounds and one assist. Another name that fans had to be happy to hear was Shabazz Muhammad, who put up 18 points (6 - 7 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) to go with four rebounds and two assists in only 14 minutes. Minnesota gets three days to recover before taking on the New York Knicks at home on Wednesday night.

The Indiana Pacers (17 - 31) throttled the New York Knicks (9 - 38) 103 - 82 Thursday at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Knicks held a five - point deficit at halftime before having a complete meltdown in the third quarter. The Pacers outscored the Knicks 33 - 12 in the third to all but ice the game. Roy Hibbert scored 10 of his 18 points in the third and added 10 rebounds in the contest to notch his 12th double - double on the season. New York earned an impressive 100 - 92 win over Oklahoma City on Wednesday but was unable to carry that momentum into Thursday's contest against Indiana. The Knicks were unable to get much of anything going in the second half. Carmelo Anthony had n't scored less than 20 points in any game this month, but was held to 18 points on 7 - of - 16 shooting against the Pacers. The Knicks have two days off before hosting the Lakers on Sunday. Indiana was able to rebound nicely after its 104 - 91 loss to Toronto on Tuesday. George Hill and C.J Miles were both able to play, but were on minutes restrictions and only saw 12 and 13 minutes respectively. Rodney Stuckey led the team in scoring, putting up 22 points on 8 - of - 13 shooting. The Pacers will look to secure their second straight win Saturday when they host the Kings.

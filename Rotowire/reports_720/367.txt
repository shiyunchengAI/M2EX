As has become the usual for Sacramento, superstar center DeMarcus "Boogie" Cousins led the way in just about every area for the Kings. Cousins posted team highs in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, with 22, 14, six, and two respectively. The impressive numbers came on what was a relatively "off" night for the star, as he shot just 8 - of - 21 from the field and 5 - of - 8 from the free - throw line with six turnovers. Sixth man Ty Lawson was dominant off the bench, posting 19 points and six assists in just 23 minutes. Detroit's bench, meanwhile, did it no favors. While typical starter Tobias Harris scored 15, the remaining backups combined for only 15 themselves. Two starters posted double - doubles, as center Andre Drummond scored 14 with 12 rebounds, and point guard Reggie Jackson scored 18 to go with 11 assists.

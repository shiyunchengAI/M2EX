The Pistons have been a different team at home this season and much of it is reliant on their defense. Not only are they 50 at Palace of Auburn Hills, they are allowing just 85 points a game at home this season. Three-point shooting killed the Thunder, as they went just 5 - of - 27 in the defeat. Without Andre Drummond, Aron Baynes had his best game of the season, recording a season - high 20 points and eight rebounds. Jon Leuer and Beno Udrih were very effective off the bench, combining for 18 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists in the win. Victor Oladipo continues to struggle in a Thunder uniform, as he scored just nine points on 4 - of - 17 shooting in the defeat. Russell Westbrook did all he could to keep Oklahoma City in the game, as he accumulated 33 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists.

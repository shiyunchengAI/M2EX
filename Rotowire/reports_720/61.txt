The Clippers (19 - 13) put an end to the Wizards' (14 - 15) hot streak with a 108 - 91 victory at Verizon Center on Monday. The big story for the Clippers has been the absence of forward Blake Griffin, who is out at least two weeks with a quad injury. The thing is, Los Angeles does n't seem to be missing Griffin that much after a third straight win - - second with Griffin sidelined. The Clippers jumped out to a commanding lead in the first quarter behind Chris Paul, who finished with a team - high 23 points and seven assists. Center DeAndre Jordan also stepped up big with Griffin out, pouring in 15 points with 13 rebounds, though Los Angeles lost the battle on the boards 45 to 37. In the end, Paul was able to get the best of John Wall, who managed to score 23 points, but disappeared late in the game in going scoreless in the fourth quarter. Despite the late - game struggles, Wall still dished out 11 assists and has posted six consecutive double - doubles. Otto Porter Jr. finally looked healthy, scoring 21 points on 8 - of - 12 shooting with three 3 - pointers and eight rebounds over 33 minutes. Porter Jr. had only played 19 minutes in the Wizards' previous game and had missed three prior to that while dealing with a thigh injury. The unsung hero of the night for the Clippers was Jamal Crawford, who is known to rise to the occasion throughout his career. He came off the bench to score 21 points on 9 - of - 12 shooting and three treys to provide some extra scoring punch behind Paul and Jordan. Other role players also stepped up; Cole Aldrich had his best game of the season with 13 points, six rebounds, four steals and three assists in 20 minutes, while Wesley Johnson added 14 points.

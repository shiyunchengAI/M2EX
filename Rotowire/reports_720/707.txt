The visiting Golden State Warriors defeated the Toronto Raptors, 127 - 121, on Wednesday at Air Canada Center. Both teams got off to a scorching hot start, scoring a combined 72 points in the first quarter, with the Raptors (7 - 4) taking an early four - point lead. But then, the Warriors (9 - 2) decided to take it to another level in the second period, dismantling Toronto in a second quarter that ended with Golden State taking a 66 - 53 lead into halftime - - a lead that they would not give up from that point on. Despite a late push from the Raptors in the closing moments of the game, the Warriors, led by 35 points from Steph Curry and 30 from Durant, ended up being far too much to handle. Klay Thompson had a rough night shooting, going just 4 - of - 15 from the field en route to 15 points. For the Raptors, DeMar DeRozan maintained his spot as the top scorer in the league with 34 points on top of four rebounds and six assists. That is his ninth 30 - point game of the season and his scoring average is now up to 33 points per game. Kyle Lowry added 24 points of his own, to go along with five rebounds and five assists, but the effort from Toronto's two All-Stars was simply not enough in the end. The loss came despite the Raptors managing to get to the line 41 times and making a grand total of 37 free throws. Up next, the Warriors will look to earn their sixth straight win of the season against the Celtics on Friday, while the Raptors will hope to end their two - game losing streak Friday against the Nuggets.

The Utah Jazz (23 - 25) picked up a Western Conference home win Wednesday over the Denver Nuggets (19 - 31) at Vivint Smart Home Arena, 85 - 81. Neither team had its deep shots working Wednesday night, as the two clubs combined to shoot 9 - 40 (23 percent) from three - point range, and both teams finished under 25 percent from deep. The Jazz won behind a strong defensive showing, primarily six blocks that helped them limit Denver to a poor 22 - 52 (42 percent) on two - point shots. Derrick Favors and Gordon Hayward scored 16 points apiece to share the team high for the Jazz. Favors notched a double - double with 11 rebounds and added a whopping six blocks as he imposed his will inside. Hayward missed all four of his three - point attempts but finished a perfect 6 - 6 at the free throw line and dished out five assists. Trevor Booker and Trey Lyles added a spark off the bench, as they combined for 15 points on 7 - 9 shooting in 31 total minutes. Danilo Gallinari battled through a tough shooting night (5 - 16 FG) to score a game - high 24 points, powered by a brilliant 12 - 14 performance at the free throw line. Kenneth Faried scored an efficient 14 points on 5 - 8 shooting and Will Barton dropped a 10 - point, 10 - rebound double - double in 23 minutes off the bench. But the offense for the Nuggets was stagnant, as they assisted on just 11 field goals and turned the ball over 14 times, preventing them from snatching the road win. Denver returns home for a matchup Friday against the Bulls. The Jazz continue their homestand with an interconference matchup Thursday against the Bucks.

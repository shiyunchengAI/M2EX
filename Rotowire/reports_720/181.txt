As was often the case on the road last year's NBA championship, the combination of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were almost enough to conquer the opposition on their own Tuesday. Irving led the way against the Knicks with 29 points on 12 - for - 22 shooting, while James and Love managed a triple - double and double - double, respectively. The pair combined for 23 boards (18 defensive) and 16 assists while shooting 27 - for - 51 (53 percent). The trio's combined scoring total of 71 points accounted for all but eight of the first unit's scoreboard contributions. By comparison, Carmelo Anthony, Derrick Rose and Kristaps Porzingis managed only a combined 52 points on a 42 percent (20 - for - 48) success rate from the floor, while the other two members of the Knicks' first unit, Courtney Lee and Joakim Noah, notably failed to score altogether.

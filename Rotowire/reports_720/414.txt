The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the visiting Denver Nuggets 121 - 106, at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday evening. The Thunder snapped a three - game losing streak, as they led for the entirety of the second half, on their way to their 14th home win of the season. Russell Westbrook led the way for Oklahoma City (22 - 16) with his 17th triple - double of the season, this time consisting of 32 points, 17 rebounds and 11 assists. Cameron Payne made his season debut for the Thunder, after missing the first part of the season while recovering from a fractured foot. Payne contributed well in 13 minutes off the bench, as he chipped in eight points on 3 - of - 4 shooting, including 2 - of - 3 from long range, along with two rebounds and one assist. Domantas Sabonis started off the game blazing, with nine points in the first quarter but did not score for the remainder of the game. Enes Kanter continued his strong play with 14 points and six rebounds, in 21 minutes off the bench. The Thunder now have a day off before they face off against the Bulls in Chicago on Monday. The Nuggets (14 - 23) kept things competitive in the first half, but could not keep up the pace beyond that, as the game progressively slipped away throughout the second half. Wilson Chandler was the high - point man for Denver, with 24 on 10 - of - 18 shooting, and added seven rebounds, two assists and two blocks, in 32 minutes off the bench. Five other players scored in double digits for the Nuggets, including Will Barton, who finished with 21 points. Barton started in place of Gary Harris (groin), who was a late scratch. Nikola Jokic also sat this one out, as he was held up by an illness. The Nuggets have now dropped two straight on the road and five straight overall, but have a few days to figure things out before their next contest on Thursday, when they host the Pacers.

The New York Knicks (15 - 62) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (18 - 60) 101 - 91 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York. In a matchup of Eastern Conference bottom feeders, the Knicks came out with the hard fought victory, despite both teams having already been eliminated from playoff contention. They were the superior shooters in this one, going 52 percent from the field, while the Sixers ended at just 38 percent. While they committed 19 turnovers to just 10 from the Sixers, the Knicks made up for it in the rebounding department, holding a 48 - 36 advantage by game's end. Andrea Bargnani was the biggest reason for the Knicks' success, as he finished with a game - high of 25 points, shooting 8 - for - 15 from the floor and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line. He also chipped in with eight rebounds, four assists and four blocked shots, doing a little bit of everything in the win. After making just 1 - of - 9 attempts from the floor in Friday's game against the Wizards, it was a step back in the right direction for one of the Knicks' biggest offensive threats. Shane Larkin was another huge factor in the win, nearly recording a triple - double. He finished with 15 points (4 - 8 FG, 7 - 8 FT), 11 rebounds and seven assists, while playing 41 minutes. The rebounds were a season - high for the guard, who has n't surpassed six yet this season. Lance Thomas and Tim Hardaway Jr were the other two Knick players to reach double figures. Thomas recorded 14 points (6 - 8 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine rebounds, while Hardaway Jr added 12 points (5 - 11 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four assists. The Sixers received most their most production from Ish Smith, who finished with 17 points (8 - 18 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 0 - 1 FT) and seven assists. Despite averaging just six points on the season, he's really picked up his offensive output lately, averaging 18 points over his last three games. Hollis Thompson came off the bench for 17 points (6 - 11 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt) of his own over 26 minutes. Like Smith, Thompson has had a really nice start to April and is averaging 16 points over his last three outings. While he had to leave Saturday's game after suffering a cut to his eye, Nerlens Noel was back in the lineup and did n't look to have any lingering issues, finishing with 14 points (7 - 14 FG, 0 - 1 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He's now pushed his season averages to 10 points and 8 rebounds on the season. The Knicks' next game will be at home against the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, while the Sixers will be at home against the Washington Wizards on Wednesday.

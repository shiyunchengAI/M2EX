The host Dallas Mavericks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 91 - 81, at American Airlines Center on Sunday. To say these teams struggled on the offensive end in this matchup would be an understatement. Dallas had one of their best defensive games of the season though, holding New Orleans to just 39 percent from the field and 25 percent from three - point range. The Mavericks shot 42 percent from the field on their end and 37 percent from three - point range. The Mavericks really turned it on late, outscoring New Orleans, 31 - 21, in the fourth quarter. All the statistics were even, as assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, points in the paint and fouls were all within two of one another. New Orleans (6 - 12) has been riding the back of Anthony Davis in their current hot streak, but he could n't quite do enough to carry them here. Davis still finished with a game - high 36 points and 13 rebounds in the defeat. No other starter scored more than nine points, with the other four starters combining for 19 points in all. Jrue Holiday had another nice game off the bench, totaling 17 points, four rebounds and six assists. No other player on the roster had more than nine points, five rebounds or three assists. The Pelicans will host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday for their next game. Dallas (3 - 13) came into this game with the lowest - scoring offense in the NBA, but they did just enough to crack their eight - game losing streak. Harrison Barnes led the Mavericks in scoring, tallying 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Wesley Matthews was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 21 points, three rebounds and three assists. Justin Anderson provided 14 points and eight rebounds off the bench. Andrew Bogut scored just five points on three shots, but grabbed 14 rebounds as the starting center. It will be tough for Dallas to add to this win, as they play the San Antonio Spurs on the road for their next game.

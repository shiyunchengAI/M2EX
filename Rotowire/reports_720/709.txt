The Utah Jazz blew out the visiting Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, 109 - 89. Utah (16 - 10) remains plagued by injuries, as starting point guard George Hill (toe) and bench combo guard Alec Burks (ankle) remained out for Wednesday's game. This did n't seem to slow the Jazz down, however, as the team clicked on both ends of the floor. Utah shot a ridiculous 58 percent from the field and 56 percent from three - point range, including 13 makes. Sophomore shooting guard Rodney Hood led the team's offense with 25 points on 9 - of - 14 shooting and 5 - of - 9 from three. On defense, Utah was able to hold Oklahoma City to just 36 percent shooting and six three - pointers. Anchoring the team's defense was center Rudy Gobert, who recorded three blocked shots and 12 rebounds, both team highs. For the second night in a row, the Thunder (15 - 11) and guard Russell Westbrook underwhelmed. Westbrook led the team with 27 points but shot an abysmal 7 - of - 25 from the floor with five turnovers. The guard also played below his averages on the glass and in the assist column, recording only six rebounds and five assists. Those numbers were also team highs, however, as the Thunder struggled to move the ball or crash the glass against Utah's tough interior lineup. The team shot only 36 percent and had just 14 assists on the night. The Jazz will host the last - place Dallas Mavericks on Friday, while the Thunder will take on the Phoenix Suns on Saturday.

Quietly, Tobias Harris has continued to have one of the more productive seasons of his career, and he's managed to do so despite taking on a role off the bench. In fact, Harris has managed to be much more productive off the bench this season compared to when he's in the starting lineup. Wednesday's performance was yet another example, as Harris shot an efficient 9 - of - 13 from the field en route to scoring 19 points to accompany his eight rebounds and four assists. In 11 games as a reserve, Harris is now averaging 19 points and 6 rebounds per game, compared to averaging 16 points and 6 rebounds per game as a starter. It should also be noted that despite having better production, Harris is playing two minutes less when he is coming off the bench.

The Raptors came into this game as a 13 - point favorite and it's a miracle that they covered that spread. Memphis actually led for the majority of the game, until Toronto turned it on in the fourth. There were 15 lead changes in total, as no team led by more than nine points until the final minutes. Shooting was key for the Raptors, as they went 55 percent from the field and 50 percent from three - point range. With Memphis playing without Mike Conley and Zach Randolph, they got contributions from everyone. In fact, all five starters scored in double figures, with Andrew Harrison leading the team with 21 points. Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan carried the load for Toronto. Lowry finished with 29 points and eight assists, while DeRozan tallied 24 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Those two combined to go 14 - of - 22 from the field and 19 - of - 21 from the free - throw line. Patrick Patterson and Cory Joseph combined for 30 points and 21 rebounds off the bench for the Raptors.

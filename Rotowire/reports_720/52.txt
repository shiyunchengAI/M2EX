The Houston Rockets (39 - 18) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (37 - 21) 110 - 105 on Wednesday at the Toyota Center in Houston. After winning two straight coming into this game, the Rockets were able to continue with their momentum and pull off the tight win over the Clippers, who have n't been playing their best basketball of late. Coming out of the third quarter, the Rockets trailed 85 - 84, but they had a great effort both offensively and defensively in the fourth, out - scoring the Clippers 26 - 20 to finish the game. The Rockets were able to force the Clippers into 16 turnovers, while committing only 10 of their own, which may have made the difference in this one. While he did n't have the monster line we've come accustomed to, James Harden still finished with 21 points (4 - 13 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 10 - 12 FT) and 10 assists as the leader of this team. It marked his second double - double in a row, combining for 52 points, 15 rebounds and 20 assists over those two games. Donatas Motiejunas got dialed in with his shot, going 7 - for - 11 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while adding nine rebounds. Motiejunas had hit just two three - pointers over his last eight games, so it was good to see him finally start hitting some shots. It marked his best offensive performance since the end of January. Trevor Ariza made his fair share of buckets as well, posting 17 points (6 - 11 FG, 5 - 9 3Pt) in 34 minutes. Along with Motiejunas, Ariza was a big help in spreading the floor to open up the lane for Harden Wednesday. Coming off the bench, Corey Brewer finished with a team - high of 20 points (7 - 17 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), to go along with six rebounds. He's now posted 20 points or more in three out of his last five games, as he's starting to heat up. Despite the loss, the Clippers saw three players break the 20 - point mark. Coming off the bench, Jamaal Crawford led the charge, going 10 - for - 17 from the field and 3 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 24 points in 33 minutes. Crawford has been absolutely unstoppable in the month of February, as he's now recorded 20 or more points in seven of his last eight games. Over that eight game stretch he's averaging 21 points. DeAndre Jordan was an absolute animal as well. In 37 minutes, he finished with 22 points (9 - 12 FG, 4 - 8 FT), 19 rebounds and two blocked shots, as the Rockets' frontcourt just could n't matchup with him. Over his last six games he's averaged 19 points and 19 rebounds, posing as one of the most consistent players for the Clippers recently. Chris Paul was the final player reaching the 20 - point mark, as he finished with 22 points (8 - 18 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and 14 assists. It was his sixth double - double in his last seven games, pushing his season averages to 18 points and 10 assists. The Rockets' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while the Clippers will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Friday.

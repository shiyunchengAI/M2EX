Hasan Whiteside truly rounded out the stat sheet in an impressively difficult matchup with the lengthy Milwaukee Bucks. It was only the third time this season that the Miami Heat were able to capture a win, and currently own a weak 3 - 8 record. The Bucks threw some curveballs at Whiteside, but no matchup proved to be too much after posting a final line of 12 points, 17 rebounds, seven blocks and two steals on 5 - of - 12 shooting. Goran Dragic (ankle) contributed a fine game in his return to the starting lineup and added 16 points, six rebounds and four assists, while Jason Richardson and Dion Waiters joined them in double figures. The bench was led by Tyler Johnson, who added eight points and eight rebounds, to go along with five assists on 3 - of - 8 shooting, including one three - pointer.

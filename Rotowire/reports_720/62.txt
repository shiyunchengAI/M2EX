The Sixers have been one of the three - worst teams in the league with Joel Embiid off the floor and that proved to be the case again here. They dug themselves too big of a hole early on, as the Bulls led by 14 points after the first quarter. Shooting was key, with Chicago hitting 51 percent from the field and 57 percent from three - point range. Ersan Ilyasova stepped up in Embiid's absence, totaling 31 points and 11 rebounds. Robert Covington was second on the team, tallying 21 points, 12 rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks. T.J. McConnell amassed 14 points and 12 assists. Jimmy Butler led the way for Chicago, as he accumulated 28 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and four steals. Robin Lopez was second on the Bulls, finishing with 21 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks. Nikola Mirotic, Doug McDermott and Paul Zipsier combined for 40 points off the bench.

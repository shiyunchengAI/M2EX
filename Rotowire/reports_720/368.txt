DeMar DeRozan's 18 - foot basket with one second remaining proved to be the game - winning shot, as Carmelo Anthony's 25 - foot three - point jumper at the buzzer failed to find the net, clinching Toronto's hard - fought road win. DeRozan compiled a game - high 37 points, while Serge Ibaka was a distant second with 15 points. Jonas Valanciunas totaled 10 points, while DeMarre Carroll supplied nine. Cory Joseph, now presumably the starting point guard for the remainder of the campaign due to Kyle Lowry's wrist injury, contributed a modest six points, four assists, three rebounds and two steals over 34 minutes. Anthony paced the Knicks with 24 points. Derrick Rose and Courtney Lee were next with matching 16 - points efforts. Lance Thomas drew another start for Kristaps Porzingis and registered 12 points. Willy Hernangomez posted eight points, nine boards and two assists.

The Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 115 - 98 at Staples Center on Wednesday. The rivalry match went in favor of the Warriors (19 - 3), even though Stephen Curry struggled on the floor of Staples Center again this season. Regardless which Los Angeles team gets put on the court, Curry is a surprising 4 - of - 28 across three contests this season. Kevin Durant also had one of his worst games in a Warriors jersey, but the team effort led by Klay Thompson's 24 points and the Clippers 40 percent shooting from the field was more than enough to hold a 20 point lead throughout most of the game. After a Draymond Green three - pointer and a Curry and - 1 layup with 2:10 left in the first quarter, Golden State went up by 15 points and did not have to look back. The closest the Clippers (16 - 7) came was seven points following a Chris Paul jumper midway through the third quarter, which cut the lead to seven points, but Green, Durant and Curry ripped off a quick scoring run to put the game out of reach. Thompson finished with 24 points, four rebounds and three assists, Curry scored 19 points but failed to make a three - pointer on eight attempts and Durant went 5 - of - 17 from the field on his way to 16 points, eight rebounds and seven assists. Green had the best all around performance after scoring 22 points and grabbing five rebounds, in addition to four assists and two steals on 8 - of - 10 shooting. Jamal Crawford provided 21 points off the bench to lead all Clippers scorers, but Chris Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin combined for just 37 points on 41 shots from the field. The weak showing from the Los Angeles starters sank their hopes of pulling out a win against their rivals, and have now dropped five of their last seven games. Next up, the Warriors play the second game of a back - to - back when they visit the Utah Jazz on Thursday, while the Clippers host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.

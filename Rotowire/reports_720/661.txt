The Sacramento Kings (29 - 53) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (21 - 61) 122 - 99 on Wednesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Because both teams have already been eliminated from the playoffs, this gave each coaching staff another shot at evaluating talent for next season. It also cemented the Lakers into having the fourth worst record in the league, which means they'll have the fourth best odds at getting the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. The Kings dominated this game, as they went 55 percent from the field and 47 percent from the three - point line, while the Lakers finished at 38 percent from the floor and 29 percent from deep. It was the duo of Ben McLemore and Derrick Williams that helped lead the Kings to such a large victory. McLemore posted 24 points (9 - 18 FG, 2 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), five rebounds and seven assists, while Williams recorded 22 points (9 - 16 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and six rebounds off the bench. McLemore has been very inconsistent all season long, so it was good to see him at least end with a strong performance. Williams also finished on a high note, as he combined for 42 points and seven rebounds over his final two outings. Ray McCallum chipped in with 19 points (7 - 14 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 9 FT) and six assists, while Nik Stauskas was in the starting lineup and posted 14 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and five assists. The Lakers were led by a huge performance from Jabari Brown. Brown went 9 - for - 19 from the field and 4 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 32 points, while also adding three rebounds. He's been one of the few bright spots here at the end of the season for the Lakers, as he's averaged 22 points over his final four games. He'll likely find himself a role somewhere next season after showing what he can do on the court this year. Vander Blue also had a solid showing, finishing with 15 points (6 - 23 FG, 1 - 8 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), seven rebounds and eight assists. With so many injuries in the backcourt, the second - year guard played the whole game Wednesday and took advantage, posting career - highs in points, rebounds and assists in just his second game for the Lakers this season. Jordan Hill added 12 points (5 - 14 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and six rebounds as well. With both teams missing the playoffs, this marks the end of their respective seasons.

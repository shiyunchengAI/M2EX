Memphis was expected to win this game rather easily, but Sacramento had some other ideas. What makes this win even more unlikely is the fact that the Kings played without Rudy Gay (hip) and had DeMarcus Cousins struggle mightily, eventually fouling out in the fourth quarter. The key for them was transition baskets, as they won the fastbreak differential, 20 - 9. Cousins still finished the game with 22 points and nine rebounds, but went just 7 - of - 20 from the field before fouling out. Kosta Koufos was the hero for the Kings, as he totaled 16 points and 13 rebounds in his best game in years. Garrett Temple got the start for Gay and tallied 17 points, six rebounds and four assists. Mike Conley made his return from a back injury to accumulate eight points, three rebounds and six assists in a rusty performance. Marc Gasol led the Grizzlies in scoring, accruing 20 points, six rebounds and four assists. Tony Allen was the only other starter in double figures, as he accrued 16 points and nine boards.

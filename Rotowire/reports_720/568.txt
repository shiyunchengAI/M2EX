The Utah Jazz (31 - 35) picked up a road win over the Sacramento Kings (25 - 40) Sunday night at Sleep Train Arena, 108 - 99. With the win, the Jazz move with two games of the Dallas Mavericks for the Western Conference's eighth and final playoff spot. This one was n't as close as the final score suggests, as the Jazz never trailed and held leads of 20 points or more in each of the second, third and fourth quarters. Derrick Favors dominated the middle for the Jazz as he finished with a team - high 28 points and a game - high 14 rebounds. Gordon Hayward chipped in 27 points (9 - 19 FG, 4 - 9 3PT, 5 - 5 FT), four rebounds, three assists and a steal. The Jazz won with hot outside shooting (12 - 28, 43 percent from three) and 11 offensive rebounds, five coming from Favors. DeMarcus Cousins scored a game - high 31 (10 - 23 FG, 3 - 6 3PT, 8 - 11 FT) and grabbed 10 rebounds in the losing effort. Omri Casspi hit all four of his three - point attempts to pitch in 20 off the bench, and Darren Collison scored 14 with five assists and a pair of steals. The Kings has solid shooting of their own (9 - 21 3PT) but their offense kicked in too late to keep with Utah's onslaught. Tha Jazz finish a back - to - back Monday at home against the Cavaliers. The Kings hit the road for a Tuesday matchup against the Lakers.

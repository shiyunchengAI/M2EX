The Detroit Pistons defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 98 - 91, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday. This game looked like a laugher early on, but Dallas made a late run in the second half for a respectable scoreline. Detroit actually took a game - high 27 - point lead headed into the half, but Dallas got it all the way down to a seven - point deficit, which happened to be the final margin. It was a wire - to - wire win for the Pistons, as they led by at least seven points for the final 44 minutes. Defense was key, as they held Dallas to 39 percent from the field and 28 percent from three - point range. Rebounding was the biggest factor for Detroit though, winning that battle, 57 - 38. The Mavericks (22 - 34) simply dug themselves too big of a hole in this game and it's not how they wanted to head into the All-star break. Dirk Nowitzki had a renaissance game though, as he led the team with 24 points and 10 rebounds. Harrison Barnes finished second on the team with 16 points and five rebounds. Seth Curry totaled 13 points, two rebounds, three assists and two steals, while Deron Williams collected 12 points, and six assists. The Pistons (27 - 30) early lead carried them to this win, but it was n't the prettiest of victories. Reggie Jackson put an end to his slump, as he led the team with 22 points, four assists and two steals. Jon Leuer was second on the team, accruing 20 points and eight rebounds. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope amassed 16 points and five rebounds. Ish Smith and Tobias Harris combined for 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists, with the rest of the bench scoring just two points in total.

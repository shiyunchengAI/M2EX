The Oklahoma City Thunder (54 - 24) demolished the Denver Nuggets (32 - 47) on their home court on Tuesday, 124 - 102. The Thunder's Russell Westbrook grabbed headlines in the third quarter by earning his NBA-leading 17th triple - double of the year. Westbrook finished with 13 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists. The All-Star point guard's mark is the most in over 25 seasons, and is far and away the most of Westbrook's already - storied career. Also making a splash, as always, was forward Kevin Durant. KD chipped in 26 points, good for a team high, and also snagged eight rebounds. The Thunder remain comfortably third in the Western Conference. The Nuggets, meanwhile, have been eliminated from playoff contention. Denver was absolutely manhandled on the glass on Tuesday, losing out in rebounds 55 - 38. Defense also played a big role in the defeat, as the Thunder got absolutely everything they wanted, converting on 53 percent of shots from the field. Denver, meanwhile, shot just a paltry 42 percent. The Thunder look poised for a first - place finish in the Northwest division, while the Nuggets remain steady at fourth. The Thunder will face off against Portland on Wednesday, while Denver will visit San Antonio on Friday.

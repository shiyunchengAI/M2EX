The New Orleans Pelicans defeated the Orlando Magic 118 - 98 Wednesday at Smoothie King Center. It was a complete team effort for the Pelicans (17 - 26), as they managed to grab a lead in the first quarter and never let go. It was n't all drama - free however, as Anthony Davis left in the middle of the game with a hand sprain, but he was able to return shortly after. The superstar big man finished with 21 points and 14 in just 29 minutes, which was his seventh double - double in his last eight games. But what really carried New Orleans through the final stretch of the game was their bench, as Langston Galloway and Tyreke Evans each scored 18 points as reserves, with the bench as a whole scoring 54 of the team's 118 points Wednesday. On top of all that, the Pelicans managed to shoot an impressive 42 percent from behind the arc. As for the Magic (17 - 27), they have now lost three in a row and seven of their last eight games following Wednesday's performance. While four of their five starters managed to score in double figures, no one was able to a put together a standout performance on a forgettable night for the team. Their main issue ended up being their inability to take care of the basketball, as they had just 18 assists to their 18 turnovers. They also ended up shooting a poor 44 percent from the field and shot just 11 free throws throughout the 48 minutes. Up next, the Pelicans will remain home Friday when they take on the Nets, while the Magic will look to turn things around Friday against the Bucks.

The New Orleans Pelicans (30 - 27) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (23 - 32) 102 - 96 on Wednesday at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans. Despite finishing with just a six - point victory, the Pelicans were much better with their shooting percentages. They went 51 percent from the field and 44 percent from the three - point line, while the Nets went 42 percent from the floor and 33 percent from deep. What really kept the Nets in this game was their ability to force the Pelicans into turnovers, as the Pelicans had 20 turnovers compared to just 12 from the Nets. This was a big win for the Pelicans, as they continue to trail the Thunder for the final projected playoff spot in the Western Conference standings. Seemingly coming out of nowhere, Quincy Pondexter was a huge reason the Pelicans were able to grab a win, despite missing both Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson. He went 9 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of 25 points, to go along with five rebounds. It was a new season - high for Pondexter in just his fourth start of the year, as it was his first time breaking the 20 - point mark. Tyreke Evans also had a strong showing, posting 15 points (5 - 13 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), 11 assists and two blocked shots. It was his third double - double over his last four games, a stretch where he's averaged 14 points and 10 assists. As long as Davis is out, Evans should continue to be the go - to player on offense. Notching a double - double of his own, Omer Asik recorded 12 points (5 - 6 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and 13 rebounds. He's combined for 26 points and 24 rebounds over his last two games. Both Norris Cole and Alexis Ajinca reached double figures in points off the bench, with 11 and 10 points respectively. The Nets saw their most production from Joe Johnson, who went 9 - for - 17 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 21 points, while adding 10 rebounds as well. He's played well of late, averaging 19 points and eight rebounds over his last three games. A big reason for the Nets keeping this game close was their bench though, who combined to score 49 of the teams 96 points. Thaddeus Young was one of those players, as he went off for 19 points (8 - 12 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 4 FT) and five rebounds. Over his last two outings with the Nets, he's combined for 34 points and 10 rebounds, as he looks to be getting more and more comfortable with his new team. Brook Lopez and Jarrett Jack were the other two bench contributors. Lopez had 15 points (7 - 14 FG, 1 - 1 FT), seven rebounds and four blocked shots, while Jack posted 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) and three assists. The Pelicans' next game will be at home against the Miami Heat on Friday, while the Nets will travel to Houston to play the Rockets on Friday.

The Los Angeles Clippers (38 - 21) defeated the Memphis Grizzlies (41 - 16) 97 - 79 Friday. Los Angeles stopped their two - game skid with the win, and they're still an impressive 5 - 3 without Blake Griffin, who continues to sit out while recovering from elbow surgery to remove an infection. DeAndre Jordan posted a double - double of 15 points and 22 rebounds in 41 minutes, continuing the dominant play that has seen him pull down at least 15 rebounds for seven straight games. The one game in which he finished with only 15 rebounds, Jordan played just 20 minutes as the Clippers blew out the Kings. Five players scored in double figures for Los Angeles as Chris Paul orchestrated the offense and collected a double - double of 19 points and 13 assists. Memphis has dropped two straight with their offense sputtering in both games. They shot just 38 percent from the field, 25 percent from beyond the arc and 67 percent from the stripe as a team Friday. Jeff Green was an anemic 0 - for - 6 from the field and played just 16 minutes despite starting at small forward. Since joining the Grizzlies, Green has struggled on offense, shooting 41 percent from the field and 31 percent from three. After losing the first two games of their season series, the Clippers were able to take the win on the road to put them in position to try and tie the series up in their final matchup when the two teams meet on April 11. The Clippers will continue their road trip against the Bulls on Sunday, and the Grizzlies will head out on the road as well to play the Timberwolves on Saturday.

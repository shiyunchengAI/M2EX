The Washington Wizards (38 - 28) needed a torrid second half shooting performance to defeat the Sacramento Kings (22 - 43) 113 - 97 on Saturday at the Verizon Center. Sacramento led by as many as 21 early in the third quarter before Washington woke up and went on a 21 - 6 run to narrow the gap. Ramon Sessions, who came over to Washington from Sacramento at the trade deadline, canned the go ahead three early in the fourth and the Wizards never looked back. DeMarcus Cousins fouled out with 5:33 remaining and the Kings could never recover, managing just nine points for the rest of the game. Sacramento's brutal eight - game road trip finally came to an end in Washington on Saturday. The Kings went just 2 - 6 on the trip to fall further towards the bottom of the Western Conference. Rudy Gay did not suit up for this game after suffering a strained patellar tendon Friday. His replacement, Omri Casspi, managed only two points and a rebound over 15 minutes on the floor. The Kings will return home on Monday to host the Hawks. The Wizards were facing their second straight opponent that was at less than full strength after playing a Memphis team that rested three starters on Thursday. It looked ugly early on, but the Wizards managed to shift into high gear to escape with a win. John Wall put on a show with 31 points and 12 assists. Nene Hilario missed his second straight game due to personal reasons and is questionable for Washington's next outing. The Wizards will host the Trail Blazers on Monday before embarking on a four - game Western Conference road trip.

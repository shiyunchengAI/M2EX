Big man Dwight Howard, meanwhile, was not particularly present in the scoring column (5 points), but made his presence felt on the boards, tallying 16 rebounds on the night. Overall, Houston had a strong offensive showing, racking up points and hitting 15 three - pointers on the night. Phoenix has seen a steady plummet towards the bottom of the Western Conference following an injury to star point guard Eric Bledsoe. The team's loss on Thursday was their 21st in 23 games. Despite holding major advantages at the line and on the boards, the Suns struggled offensively, recording 24 turnovers and shooting just 39 percent from the field.

Phoenix next sees the court on Saturday as well, as the team will face off against the Utah Jazz.

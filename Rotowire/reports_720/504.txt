The Utah Jazz (10 - 20) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (4 - 25) 88 - 71 on Saturday. Utah has won four of their last five games. They shot a horrible 36 percent from the field and 17 percent from beyond the arc but were able to overcome the Sixers by holding them to an even more deplorable 32 percent shooting from the field and 19 percent from beyond the arc. Derrick Favors led the way for the Jazz with 17 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks, doing his best Anthony Davis impression to help secure the win. Trevor Booker returned to the lineup after sitting out their last game. He put up 14 points and five rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. Utah will go on the road to play the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday. Philadelphia has lost two straight, but they continue to play well defensively. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute sat out the game with a calf strain, giving Henry Sims an opportunity to crawl back into the starting lineup. Sims put up 10 points and eight rebounds in 32 minutes. JaKarr Sampson started the game at shooting guard in place of Hollis Thompson (illness), but Sampson was replaced in the starting lineup by Tony Wroten to begin the second half. Wroten finished with 20 points and six rebounds in 32 minutes. The Sixers will continue their road trip against the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday.

The host Sacramento Kings took down the eighth - seeded Denver Nuggets on Thursday, 116 - 100. The game was the first for Sacramento (25 - 33) since the team dealt superstar center DeMarcus Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night. Rookie shooting guard Buddy Hield, the reigning sixth overall pick and centerpiece of the trade, made a strong debut on Thursday, scoring 16 points and shooting an efficient 6 - of - 10 from the field. It was sophomore center Willie Cauley-Stein, however, who made the strongest impression in the new - look Kings lineup. After spending the first part of his career playing alongside or behind Cousins in the rotation, Cauley-Stein had a breakout game on Thursday, scoring 29 points on 14 - of - 22 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds. Despite dealing Cousins and veteran forward Rudy Gay (achilles) being out for the remainder of the season. the Kings saw a high - functioning offense against Denver. The team shot over 52 percent from the field and made half its three - point attempts. Denver (25 - 32) was left disappointed by the outcome, as the Nuggets were blown out by a gutted Kings team. One of the biggest obstacles for Denver was overcoming the defense of Sacramento's Willie Cauley-Stein. The Kings successfully hounded the Nuggets all night and held Denver's star center, Nikola Jokic, to just four points on the night. Denver shot only 44 percent and was out - rebounded by seven in the game. The team's high scorer was shooting guard Gary Harris with 23 points. Denver will host the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while Sacramento will host the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday.

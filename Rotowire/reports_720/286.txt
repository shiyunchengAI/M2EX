The Oklahoma City Thunder (33 - 27) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (16 - 42) 108 - 101 on Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The Thunder got out to a quick start Sunday, out - scoring the Lakers 28 - 19 right away in the first quarter. That was really important for the Thunder, as the Lakers ended up as the better shooting team. The Lakers finished at 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line, while the Thunder went 41 percent from the floor and 34 percent from deep. The Thunder did finish with a 54 - 49 rebounding advantage though, which may have been just enough of an edge to overcome the Lakers push. This was a big win for the Thunder, who had lost two games in a row. To make things worse, they were also without both Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, so they had some role players really step up. D.J. Augustin was a big reason for the success without the Thunders' superstars. Starting at point guard, he finished with 18 points (6 - 15 FG, 4 - 10 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), eight rebounds and five assists. It was far - and - away his best showing since coming over to the Thunder at the trade deadline just six games ago. It was also a very timely performance, considering the injury woes. Serge Ibaka was also a huge factor in the win, posting 18 points (6 - 17 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT) of his own, to go along with 14 rebounds and three blocked shots. He's picked it up offensively of late, averaging 18 points over his last seven games. Enes Kanter also took advantage of a good matchup against the Lakers' frontcourt. He finished with 16 points (6 - 10 FG, 4 - 6 FT), 15 rebounds and five assists, notching his third double - double since joining the Thunder. In the five games since the trade deadline, he's averaging 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers saw a ton of production from their bench Sunday. Jeremy Lin was a big reason the Lakers had a chance at a win. He went 7 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to finish with a game - high of 20 points, while adding six rebounds and eight assists in a near triple - double. He's picked his game up for the Lakers lately, averaging 17 points and six assists over his last four outings. Also off the bench, Jordan Hill posted 14 points (5 - 10 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and 12 rebounds. Despite coming off the bench, he's stayed prodcutive and has combined for 44 points over his last three games. He's now averaging 12 points and 8 rebounds on the season. Running with the starters, both Jordan Clarkson and Wayne Ellington had some success. Clarkson finished with 12 points (5 - 14 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt) and four assists, while Ellington had 12 points (5 - 15 FG, 1 - 8 3Pt, 1 - 3 FT), six rebounds and six assists.

The Dallas Mavericks (37 - 38) held off the New York Knicks (30 - 46) for a 91 - 89 win on Wednesday. This game meant much more to the Mavericks than Knicks and they were lucky to escape with a victory. They really won it in the fourth, as they held the Knicks to 15 points and scored 24 of their own. The key for Dallas was the defense, as they forced New York to commit 20 turnovers in their much needed win. New York had to play this game without Kristaps Porzingis and nearly walked away with a big road win. Carmelo Anthony was spectacular once again, as he accumulated 31 points, seven rebounds and three steals in the defeat. Derrick Williams was the only other Knick in double figures, as he scored 15 points and grabbed eight boards. Up next for New York is a matchup with the Brooklyn Nets on Friday. This win keeps the Mavericks playoff hopes alive, but it's indicative of their recent form. J.J. Barea gave one of his best performances of his career, as he tallied 26 points, five rebounds and seven assists. Wesley Matthews led all starters with 16 points and also provided four assists and three steals in the win. The Mavericks will look to keep their playoff hopes alive on Friday against the Detroit Pistons.

The Utah Jazz (24 - 25) beat the Milwaukee Bucks (20 - 32) 84 - 81 on Friday. The Jazz stifled the Bucks in the second half to walk away with their fifth - straight win. They held Milwaukee to just 37 points in the second half and forced them to commit 20 turnovers while shooting 42 percent from the field. Utah also combined for 23 blocks and steals in the game and that's one of the highest totals of the season. This gives Milwaukee their fifth - straight loss and it was an extremely tough night on the offensive end. No player scored more than 18 points in the loss with the five starters combining for 18 turnovers. Khris Middleton's 18 points, six rebounds and three steals look good, but considering he shot 6 - for - 16 and committed nine turnovers, it was actually very ugly. Jerryd Bayless gave the team a nice spark off the bench, as he scored 15 points. Milwaukee will have a few days off until they play the Boston Celtics on Monday in their next game. Utah has been playing their best defense of the season in recent weeks and it came to a head here. Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors were incredible down low, as they combined for 23 rebounds, seven steals and eight blocks in the win. Rodney hood led the team with 23 points and also got two steals of his own. The Jazz are now allowing 85 points a game across their last seven games, which is tops in the NBA. On deck for Utah is a game against the Phoenix Suns on Saturday in a back - to - back set.

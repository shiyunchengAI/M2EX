The Washington Wizards (46 - 34) defeated the Atlanta Hawks (60 - 20) 108 - 99 on Sunday in Washington. It was a game where neither team had much to play for, as the Hawks are locked in as the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Wizards are locked in as the No. 5 seed. The only difference Sunday night was that Atlanta rested their starters, while Washington played at full strength. After sitting out to rest the previous two games, All-Star John Wall returned for the Wizards to put up 24 points (9 - 20 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), nine assists and four rebounds in 35 minutes. He did, however, have a game - high 10 turnovers. Nene Hilario shook off a rough stretch of play he has had as of late to record a double - double of 14 points and 10 rebounds in 27 minutes, while Marcin Gortat felt one rebound shy of putting up a double - double of his own, posting 15 points and nine rebounds in 32 minutes. Bradley Beal scored 17 points and Paul Pierce added 14, putting every Washington starter in double figures. The game was won on the boards, as Washington dominated down low, outrebounding Atlanta 51 - 38. Despite resting their regular starters, the Hawks still put together a solid performance. Mike Scott led the way for them off the bench, scoring 19 points (6 - 15 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt) in 30 minutes. John Jenkins was close behind, scoring 17 points (6 - 12 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt) in 35 minutes. Dennis Schroder got the start and put up 14 points (6 - 16 FG), six rebounds and three assists in 29 minutes. Shelvin Mack came off the bench to run the show and put up 14 points (5 - 12 FG), six assists and four rebounds in 26 minutes. Up next, the Wizards will travel to Indiana Tuesday to take on the Pacers, while Atlanta heads back home Monday to play the Knicks.

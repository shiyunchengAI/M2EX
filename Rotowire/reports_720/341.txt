Last year's top two Rookie of the Year vote - getters squared off in epic fashion on Wednesday night. Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns posted an absurd career - high 47 points on 15 - of - 22 shooting and 17 - of - 20 from the line. The big man also pulled down a game - high 18 rebounds and had three blocks. Towns hit three of the Wolves' four made three - pointers on the night and accounted for nearly half the team's scoring output. Aside from his strong play, the Wolves struggled, shooting just 44 percent as a team and hitting only four three - pointers on the night. Sophomore big man Kristaps Porzingis, meanwhile, led the way for the victorious Knicks. The forward had 29 points on 11 - of - 20 shooting, including three three - pointers. Porzingis added eight rebounds, four assists, and two blocks. The Knicks eviscerated Minnesota from beyond the arc, hitting 13 three - pointers to Minnesota's four.

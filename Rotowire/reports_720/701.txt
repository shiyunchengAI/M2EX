The Washington Wizards (40) defeated the Toronto Raptors (0 - 4) 125 - 94 on Sunday during game four of the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Behind a very impressive shooting performance as a team, the Wizards were able to finish the series sweep of the Raptors, as they eliminated them from the playoffs Sunday with the win. The Wizards got off to an extremely quick start, shooting 71 percent from the field and 60 percent from the three - point line in the first quarter to secure a 14 - point lead. They carried that momentum into the second and pushed themselves up by 16 points at the break. The Wizards never let off the gas and at one point led by 36 points, as the Raptors just did n't have an answer for the Wizards' offense. The Wizards had seven players reach double figures in points in this one, receiving a nice effort from their bench to go along with some other impressive performances between the starters. Bradley Beal led the way with 23 points (5 - 15 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 10 - 11 FT), while also adding five assists and four steals. Beal was one of the big reasons for the quick start considering he had eight points at the end of the first quarter and 15 points by halftime. Beal has had a big post - season thus far, averaging 21 points over his first four contests. John Wall got off to a hot start as well though and finished the game with 14 points (3 - 5 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT) and 10 assists. He could've put up some much higher numbers, but he was limited to just 25 minutes due to the huge lead the Wizards had early on in the game. Coming up with a surprise performance was Marcin Gortat, as he posted 21 points (8 - 9 FG, 5 - 7 FT) and 11 rebounds over 29 minutes. After not doing too much in the first two games of this series, he really picked it up over the last two, combining for 45 points and 24 rebounds during that stretch, while notching two double - doubles in a row. Drew Gooden and Ramon Sessions received extra time off the bench with the lead. Gooden added 13 points (5 - 8 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt) and four rebounds, while Sessions had 15 points (5 - 7 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three assists. After struggling during the start of the playoffs, Kyle Lowry finally found some production for the Raptors. He went 8 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score 21 points, while also adding eight rebounds and four assists. He did turn the ball over six times though and received a technical for throwing the ball in frustration at the referee, so Lowry did n't necessarily have the type of success that he had hoped coming into the 2015 NBA Playoffs and he ends his season in disappointing fashion. Jonas Valanciunas nearly recorded a double - double with 16 points (7 - 10 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and nine rebounds. It was a solid end to the season for Valanciunas, who averaged 12 points and 9 rebounds during the regular season. Both DeMar DeRozan and Louis Williams reached double figures as well. DeRozan finished with 14 points (6 - 13 FG, 2 - 2 FT), four assists and three steals, while Williams chipped in with 14 points (4 - 11 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and one rebound. The Raptors just could n't keep up with the Wizards' shooting as Toronto finished at just 44 percent from the field and a meager 28 percent from deep. The Wizards will now have to wait to see who wins the Atlanta Hawks/Brooklyn Nets series in order to find out who they'll play next. The Hawks currently lead that matchup 2 - 1.

The New York Knicks (9 - 10) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (1 - 19) 99 - 85 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York. After securing their first win of the season on Tuesday, the Sixers were hoping to get their momentum moving in the right direction. Unfortunately, that was n't the case Wednesday, as the Knicks came in and snapped a four - game losing streak of their own with the 14 - point victory over the Sixers.The Sixers forced the Knicks into 17 turnovers as a team, but could n't get anything going offensively, shooting just 37 percent from the field and 32 percent from the three - point line. Conversely, the Knicks shot 44 percent from the floor and 20 percent from deep. It was Kristaps Porzingis, the Knicks' electrifying first - round pick, who again stole the show Wednesday. Porzingis was very efficient offensively, scoring a team - high of 17 points (6 - 10 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), to go along with 10 rebounds and four blocked shots. He's now notched two double - doubles in a row, which brings his season total to nine. Porzingis is averaging 14 points, 9 rebounds and 2 blocks on the season. After missing Sunday's game due to an illness, superstar Carmelo Anthony returned to the lineup. Anthony did n't have the best game shooting the ball, but still finished with 12 points (5 - 16 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), while also adding six rebounds and a pair of assists. Anthony has combined to shoot just 9 - for - 29 from the field and 1 - for - 6 from the three - point line over his last two games, so he'll look to turn things around moving forward. Arron Afflalo chipped in with 13 points (6 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt) and eight rebounds as well. With Jahlil Okakor being suspended two games due to a few off - court incidents, the Sixers had JaKarr Sampson move into the starting lineup. Sampson led all Sixer scorers with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), to go along with five rebounds over 23 minutes. The 12 points were the most he's scored since the season opener, considering he's averaging just 6 points and 3 rebounds on the season. Sampson should get the start again Saturday with Okafor remaining out on suspension. Hollis Thompson and Richaun Holmes came off the bench and tried to give the Sixers a much - needed spark. Thompson recorded 13 points (5 - 12 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) and four rebounds, while Holmes added 11 points (4 - 6 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and three rebounds. The Knicks' next game will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while the Sixers will head home to play the Denver Nuggets on Saturday.

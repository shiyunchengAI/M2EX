The Los Angeles Clippers (41 - 23) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (14 - 48) 89 - 76 on Monday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. After losing two games in a row, the Clippers ran into the struggling Timberwolves at the right time, as they were able to take home the 13 - point victory in front of their home crowd. Helping to do that was their shooting, as they went 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 37 percent from the floor and a meager 25 percent from deep. With such a large advantage in that category for the Clippers, the Timberwolves really never stood a chance. J.J. Redick and DeAndre Jordan formed an unstoppable duo in this matchup. Jordan went 10 - for - 11 from the field to score 20 points, while also adding 17 rebounds and two blocked shots. This marked his thirteenth straight game with at least 10 rebounds. He had been struggling with his offense lately though, combining for just 12 points in his two previous games, so it was good to see the center put up some numbers this time around. Redick, on the other hand, went 10 - for - 19 from the floor and 3 - for - 7 from the three - point line for a team - high of 26 points. He's now shot over 40 percent in four straight games, a stretch where he's averaging 22 points per game. Coming off the bench, Austin Rivers added 13 points (5 - 8 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and six assists in just 22 minutes. He's seen extended time with Jamal Crawford out with an injury and has posted two strong performances in a row, after going off for 22 points in Sunday's game against the Warriors. Chris Paul struggled offensively with just two points (1 - 6 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt), but made up for it by notching 15 assists, as his teammates were knocking down everything they could get their hands on. Adreian Payne did everything he could to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the free throw line to finish with a team - high of 16 points, while adding 15 rebounds and a blocked shot over 37 minutes. It was his second double - double of the season in just his third career start, while he set season - highs in both points and rebounds in the loss as well. Posting a double - double of his own, Nikola Pekovic recorded 12 points (5 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 FT) and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes. It marked his first double - double over his last three games, after posting five straight previous to that. He's now averaging 13 points and 8 rebounds on the season. Andrew Wiggins and Kevin Martin were the other two Timberwolves to finish in double figures. Wiggins finished with 11 points (5 - 16 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and five rebounds, while Martin added 10 points (2 - 6 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT) and two assists. The Clippers' next game will be on the road against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Phoenix to play the Suns on Wednesday.

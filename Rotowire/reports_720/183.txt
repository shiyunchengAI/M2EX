The box score numbers all got slightly padded given the 10 extra minutes of play spread out over two overtimes in the thrilling matchup. James Harden's triple - double headlined the game, given the Rockets big win, even after the Warriors simply would not go away at the end of regulation and the first overtime. Harden went on to finish with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 13 assists on 8 - of - 23 shooting, including 11 - of - 14 from the charity stripe. Kevin Durant, on the other side of the box score, had an even more impressive night when it came to the numbers. Across 49 minutes of action, the former MVP finished with 39 points, in addition to 13 rebounds, two assists, three blocks and three steals on 12 - of - 28 shooting. The offseason acquisition also went a perfect 12 - of - 12 from the free throw line.

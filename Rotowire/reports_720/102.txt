The San Antonio Spurs (16 - 6) defeated the New York Knicks (4 - 20) 109 - 95 on Wednesday. San Antonio was playing on the second night of a back - to - back set, coming off a 100 - 96 loss to the Utah Jazz on Tuesday. As coach Gregg Popovich is wont to do, he opted to sit all of his starters, since the team was already missing several players due to injury. Tony Parker (hamstring) missed his third straight game. Kawhi Leonard suffered a hand injury in Tuesday's game that kept him out as well. Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan sat out to get rest, though Ginobili is supposedly dealing with a shoulder issue as well. Tiago Splitter had missed all but one game so far this season with a calf injury but made his return to action Wednesday, playing eight minutes off the bench. All 10 available players saw action for the Spurs, and all of them finished with a positive plus/minus. They'll host the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, and if the team is eager to get their players more rest, it's possible they'll use the same lineup Friday. New York is on a 10 - game losing streak, and the media's honeymoon with the new front office led by Phil Jackson and the team's rookie head coach Derek Fisher seemed to come to an end this week as several outlets began questioning his rotation choices and the team's dogged push to install the triangle offense. As a team, they performed well on offense, shooting 49 percent from the field, but they committed 25 personal fouls, giving the Spurs 25 free points at the foul line, which ultimately was their downfall. Carmelo Anthony sat out the game with left knee soreness. The Knicks will continue their road trip in Boston on Friday against the Celtics, and Anthony's status for the game remains unknown.

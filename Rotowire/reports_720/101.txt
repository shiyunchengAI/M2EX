The Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 144 - 98, at Oracle Arena on Saturday. There are n't many NBA games that are as lopsided as this one, but that's just how good the Warriors can be. Not only did they lead by 21 at the half, they took a 44 - point lead into the fourth quarter. The shooting was incredible, as they went 57 - of - 92 from the field and 17 - of - 34 from three - point range. Rebounding was a huge difference as well, with Golden State winning that battle, 47 - 32. The Warriors also handed out 35 assists on their 57 made baskets. The Clippers (30 - 18) had to play this game without Chris Paul, but not even his elite defense could have done anything about this onslaught. Blake Griffin did all he could for Los Angeles, as he led the team with 20 points, four rebounds and two assists, Austin Rivers played 37 minutes and accumulated 10 points, two rebounds and six assists. Raymond Felton played well off the bench, totaling 10 points, seven rebounds and five assists. The Clippers will be off until Wednesday, when they play the Phoenix Suns on the road for their next game. The Warriors (40 - 7) have the best offensive numbers in the league, but this performance may have been their best of the season. Stephen Curry was unconscious, as he tallied 43 points, nine rebounds and six assists in three quarters of action. Kevin Durant was second on the team, as he accrued 23 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Klay Thompson was the only other starter in double figures, as he dropped 16 points. Those three players combined to go 31 - of - 45 from the field. Andre Iguodala had a nice game off the bench, providing nine points, six rebounds and five assists. Golden State will play the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday for their next game in the second half of a back - to - back set.

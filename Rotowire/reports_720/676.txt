The San Antonio Spurs remained undefeated in their 106 - 99 win over the host Miami Heat on Sunday at American Airlines Center. In a game that was tight throughout, the more veteran squad prevailed. San Antonio (40) dominated the shooting, as it hit 56 percent of its three - pointers and 86 percent of its free - throws. Despite tying in defensive rebounds, San Antonio was able to win the offensive rebounding margin 14 - 6. Miami (1 - 2) did dominate down low, though, outscoring the Spurs 46 - 32 in the paint. Another key for the Spurs was their ability to score off turnovers, as they won that battle 21 points to 10. Kawhi Leonard was the star for the Spurs once again, tallying 27 points and six assists. The reigning two - time Defensive Player of the Year scored the final 10 points for the Spurs and accumulated 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter. Pau Gasol was the only other starter in double figures, totaling 20 points and 11 rebounds in his first double - double of the year. In fact, their three other starters combined for just 16 points in the win. Patty Mills did provide 18 points off the bench but failed to record any other fantasy - relevant stats in 25 minutes of action. Four Heat players scored in double figures in their loss, but no one else did much of anything. In fact, the other five players combined for just 17 points. Hassan Whiteside carried the load for the Heat, contributing 27 points, 15 rebounds and four blocks in the loss. Goran Dragic was second - highest scorer, adding 25 points of his own, while adding five assists and three boards. Justise Winslow had a nice game, as well, totaling 18 points and five rebounds. Tyler Johnson was the only bench player to score more than two points, as he chipped in 12 in 30 minutes of play. Both teams return to action on Tuesday, as the Spurs host the Utah Jazz and the Heat host the Sacramento Kings.

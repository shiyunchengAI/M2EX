The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets, 106 - 101, at Barclays Center on Tuesday evening. The Sixers (28 - 46) continue to push for as many victories as possible after such a considerable degree of futility over the last several seasons, and their fighting spirit helped them prevail against an equally feisty Nets (16 - 58) squad on Tuesday. Philadelphia had forged a razor - thin 58 - 57 lead by halftime but had to fight until the closing seconds to pull out the win. Neither team shot particularly well but it was two 20 - point - plus efforts by Robert Covington and Dario Saric that led the way for the Sixers and spearheaded their 11th road win of the season. Saric paced Philadelphia with 23 points, which he supplemented with seven rebounds, an assist and a block. Covington produced a 21 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included an assist, two steals and two blocks. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot produced a near double - double with 17 points, nine boards, three assists, a steal and a block. Richaun Holmes generated 13 points, five boards and two assists. T.J. McConnell supplied a full stat line of eight points, 10 assists, two rebounds, three steals and a block. Nik Stauskas led the bench with 11 points, four rebounds, two assists and a block. Brook Lopez led Brooklyn with 26 points, nine rebounds, six assists and two blocks. Jeremy Lin filled out the stat sheet with 11 points, seven assists, six rebounds and four steals. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson matched Lin's point total and added seven rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks. Caris LaVert turned in nine points and five rebounds, while Spencer Dinwiddie led the bench with 10 points, five assists, four rebounds and one steal. The Sixers head back home to tangle with the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday evening, while the Nets head to Motown to do battle with the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night.

James Harden has been seen as a legitimate MVP candidate in this young NBA season with his ability to stuff the stat sheet with points, assists and rebounds. He has, however, also managed to stuff it with turnovers as of late, especially when his assist number is high. In his last three games with at least 15 assists - - one of which happened in Wednesday night's loss - - Harden has also posted at least eight turnovers. The 12 turnovers he had Wednesday was his season high and the first time he reached double - digit turnovers this season. For the Raptors, their MVP candidate DeMar DeRozan had another strong, 24 - point performance, but did n't come as easy as the box score may indicate. An astonishing 21 of of his 24 points came in the third quarter Wednesday night, as he managed to score 11 straight points for Toronto at one point in the period. He's managed to keep his scoring average above 30 points, now at 31 points per game after Wednesday's performance.

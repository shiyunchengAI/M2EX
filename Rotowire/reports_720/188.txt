Wednesday's game was a shockingly strong performance from the Mavericks, as the 104 points they scored against the Clippers was the first time they scored over 100 points since Nov. 9 against the Lakers, which also happened to be the last time they won a game. In their six games prior to Wednesday, Dallas was averaging a lowly 82 points per game, a stretch highlighted by a 64 - point performance against the Grizzlies. There were a lot of signs as to why the Mavericks managed to have an effective scoring night Wednesday, including shooting a high mark from behind the arc (11 - of - 24), capitalizing on their trips to the free throw line (17 - of - 18) and most importantly, rebounding. The Mavericks actually out - rebounded the Clippers 44 to 43 and managed to grab 10 offensive rebounds against a strong rebounding team in Los Angeles, giving them multiple possessions and opportunities for second - chance points.

The New York Knicks defeated the Indiana Pacers 109 - 103 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Monday. Carmelo Anthony finally got a game winning jumper to fall after a handful of failed attempts though January, and the Derrick Rose assisted baseline fadeaway with :23 remaining in the fourth quarter was enough for New York (20 - 26) to come away with a road victory. The Pacers (22 - 22) made one crucial error that put the game away for the Knicks, as Myles Turner mishandled a pass resulting in a turnover following Anthony's go - ahead jumper. Courtney Lee was able to add on to the Knicks lead with seconds remaining from the free throw line to put the game away for good. Myles Turner had a series on the defensive end of the floor where he blocked a Derrick Rose transition layup and then followed up by going coast - to - coast to put back a misfired shot from the Pacers. Save for Turner's costly error at the end of the game, the young Indiana center went on to score 22 points and grab 10 rebounds, to go along with two blocks. Paul George led all scorers in the contest with 31 points on 11 - of - 24 shooting, while Jeff Teague scored seven points, dished out seven assists and grabbed four rebounds. Anthony led the Knicks in scoring with 26 points on 9 - of - 17 shooting, in addition to two assists and five boards. Kristaps Porzingis fouled out of the game late in the fourth quarter, which went along with the rough night of eight points on 11 shots. Rose added 20 points, six assists and three rebounds across a game high 40 minutes. Next up, the Knicks visit the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Pacers visit the Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday.

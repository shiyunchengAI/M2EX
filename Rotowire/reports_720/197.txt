The Oklahoma City Thunder (27 - 25) beat the Denver Nuggets (19 - 33), 124 - 114, on Monday. Kevin Durant had his second - best scoring performance of the season with 40 points on 13 - of - 19 from the field. Russell Westbrook added 26 points with five rebounds and nine assists. Starting in place of Steven Adams, who recently had surgery on his fractured hand, Kendrick Perkins played 20 minutes, recording four points and two rebounds. Mitch McGary followed up his 19 - point, 10 - rebound performance from Sunday with 17 points and 10 rebounds. He did n't play more than 25 minutes in either game but could be a force going forward with Perkins underproducing and Adams out for a few weeks. The Nuggets are slipping fast. They are 1 - 13 since winning five straight in early January. Kenneth Faried put up 22 points and 10 rebounds, but it was n't nearly enough to overcome Durant's hot shooting night. Jusuf Nurkic had 16 points, 14 rebounds and two steals. Denver was without JaVale McGee (illness) and Jameer Nelson (Achilles), who were both questionable going into Monday's game. The Nuggets are now nine - and - a - half games back from the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. The Thunder will take on the Grizzlies in Memphis on Wednesday, while the Nuggets will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Tuesday.

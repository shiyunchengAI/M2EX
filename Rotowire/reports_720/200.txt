The Los Angeles Clippers (21 - 13) held on for a road victory Thursday over the New Orleans Pelicans (10 - 22) at the Smoothie King Center, 95 - 89. Despite one of Chris Paul’s worst shooting games as a professional — 3 - 18, including 0 - 4 from three - point land — the Clippers held on and extended their winning streak to five games. After trailing for most of the first half, the Clippers took a 50 - 48 lead late in the second quarter and trailed only for 17 seconds in the second half as they managed to stave off a late but futile New Orleans run. J.J. Redick’s hot shooting night, including 9 - 15 from the field and 4 - 7 from three - point land, gave him 26 points to lead all scorers. Paul still scored nine points, grabbed five rebounds and dished out 12 assists despite his awful shooting night. DeAndre Jordan was a monster on the glass, as he grabbed 20 rebounds — including eight on the offensive end — and scored 11 points as he owned the paint in Blake Griffin’s absence. The Pelicans had six players finish in double figures, but Ryan Anderson was the only one to find his groove, as he led the club with 17 points on an efficient 7 - 11 shooting. Anthony Davis and Tyreke Evens scored 14 points each and Norris Cole scored 15, but none managed to shoot 50 percent from the floor. The Pelicans shot 44 percent as a team and needed to be more accurate to overcome their rebounding disadvantage. The Clippers match up next with Philadelphia at home on Saturday. The Pelicans travel to Dallas for a Saturday date with the Mavericks.

The Toronto Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 122 - 100, at Air Canada Centre on Monday. DeMar DeRozan has taken his game up to another level this season, and he's often been joined in many of his exploits by backcourt mate Kyle Lowry. However, Monday, it was another sharpshooting guard that helped supplement a team - high 30 points from DeRozan, as Terrence Ross came off the bench to pour in 25 points for Toronto (17 - 7). The pair went a combined 17 - of - 28 from the field, leading the Raptors to outstanding 51 and 56 percent success rates from the field and three - point range, respectively. The Bucks (11 - 12) got their own stellar 30 - point performance from Giannis Antetokounmpo, who complemented his haul with eight rebounds, five assists and three steals. Jabari Parker was next with 27 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. However, only one other Bucks player managed to get into double digits in the scoring column, and that effort came from the bench in the person of Greg Monroe (11 points). Tony Snell (eight points), John Henson (seven points) and Matthew Dellavedova (two points) considerably underwhelmed on the first unit. DeRozan added three rebounds and three assists to his team - high point total. Lowry went for 18 points, seven assists, three rebounds and a steal. DeMarre Carroll supplied 13 points, seven rebounds, two assists and a steal. Jonas Valanciunas registered an 11 - point, 13 - rebound double - double that also included an assist.

The Chicago Bulls (49 - 32) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (37 - 44) 113 - 86 on Monday. Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to lead the Bulls with 26 points in 24 minutes. He has continued to impress when he gets the chance to play. In March he averaged 21 points, 8 rebounds and 1 blocks in 31 minutes a game. He was putting up 10 points and 5 rebounds in April, coming into Monday's game. His role was increased against Brooklyn because Joakim Noah sat out with a knee injury. Taj Gibson also saw an uptick in minutes. He jumped into the starting lineup at power forward for the Bulls, as Pau Gasol was moved to center. Gibson had 15 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots. Gasol had a dominant all - around performance with 22 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocks against a hot Brook Lopez. Chicago has the night off on Tuesday and will host the number one seed in the Eastern Conference, the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday. The Bulls will either be the number two or number three seed. On their off - day Tuesday, they can watch the Toronto Raptors, who they are currently battling for the second seed with. The Nets ran into a tough Bull's defense and had a hard time getting their starters points. Lopez lead the Bulls with 13 points to go along with eight rebounds, but he would've liked to have a better game with Noah out of the lineup. Jarrett Jack and Bojan Bogdanovic combined for 32 points off the bench but it was n't nearly enough as Chicago took it too the Nets in a 30 - 15 third quarter to add to the seven point lead they already had at halftime. This loss dropped the Nets out of the eighth seed in the playoffs for the time being. The Indiana Pacers had off Monday, as they slipped into the eighth seed with the Brooklyn's loss. The Nets will host the Orlando Magic on Wednesday as they hope for a playoff birth.

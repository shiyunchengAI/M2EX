Things looked to finally be turning around for Klay Thompson, who got off to an incredibly rough start to the regular season. However, after four straight games where he shot over 50 percent from the field, he posted another clunker of a game on Wednesday night, shooting just 5 - of - 14 from the field en route to an underwhelming 15 points. Most striking, though, might have been his 3 - of - 11 performance from long range and his performances from behind the arc all season. Through his five - year NBA career, Klay has not made less than 40 percent of his 3 - point attempts. Through 11 games this season, Klay is shooting just 32 percent from behind the arc, and while the Warriors are surviving despite the sharpshooter fighting inconsistencies and failing to live up to standards, they'll want their shooting guard playing his best when it really matters.

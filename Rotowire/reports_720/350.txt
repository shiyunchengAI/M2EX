The Chicago Bulls (41 - 28) dominated the Indiana Pacers (30 - 37) 103 - 86 on Wednesday in Chicago. Nikola Mirotic has thrived in his sixth man role, as Taj Gibson missed his 10th straight game, and Wednesday was no different. Mirotic scored a game - high 25 points on 8 - of - 15 shooting and grabbed nine rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench. In his last two games, Mirotic has scored 52 points and grabbed 13 rebounds and is due for a minutes increase even when Gibson returns from injury. After four straight games scoring in single digits, Mike Dunleavy put together a solid performance, scoring 21 points on 7 - of - 14 shooting, to along with five rebounds. Pau Gasol recorded yet another double - double, posting 19 points on 7 - of - 13 shooting and 12 rebounds in 33 minutes, while Joakim Noah scored just six points, but was active elsewhere, recording 14 rebounds and seven assists. The win pushes Chicago to just a half game behind the Raptors for third place in the Eastern Conference standings and two and a half games behind the second - place Cavaliers. However, they still only hold a one - game lead over the Wizards for fourth place. Four starters scored in double figures for the Pacers in the losing effort, but as a team, they could not get anything going, shooting poorly at 40 percent from the field. Solomon Hill led the team in scoring, putting up just 13 points on 5 - of - 10 shooting, six rebounds and three rebounds. Roy Hibbert (12), George Hill (10) and C.J. Miles (10) round out the four Indiana starters in double figures, while Rodney Stuckey put up just 11 points on 4 - of - 11 shooting in 31 minutes off the bench. The loss moves Indiana out of the current playoff race in the East, as the Celtics own the tie breaker over them. However, they still stand just one game behind the seventh - place Heat. Up next, the Bulls will take on the Raptors at home on Friday, while the Pacers will head to Cleveland on Friday to play the Cavaliers.

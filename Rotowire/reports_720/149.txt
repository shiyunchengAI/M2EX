The San Antonio Spurs (62 - 12) picked up a road win over the Memphis Grizzlies (41 - 33) despite resting many of their top players Wednesday night at FedExForum, 101 - 87. Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili were both inactive, and David West, Kawhi Leonard and Tony Parker all sat out as the Spurs continue to get their bodies rested for the postseason. Still, with the Grizzlies missing Marc Gasol, Mike Conley, Zach Randolph and P.J. Hairston to injuries, the Spurs faced little resistance as they took an 8 - point lead into halftime and led by double - digits for the entire fourth quarter. LaMarcus Aldridge was San Antonio's lone star in the lineup, and he dominated the game, scoring a game - high 31 points (11 - 16 FG, 9 - 11 FT) and grabbing a game - high 13 rebounds (four offensive). Patty Mills (7 - 10 FG, 3 - 4 3PT) added 17 points in 22 minutes off the bench. The Spurs shot a robust 51 percent from the field as Memphis's depleted front line offered little resistance inside. Vince Carter was Memphis's leading scorer as he managed 14 points (3 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 6 - 7 FT) in 21 minutes off the bench. Jeff Green's 12 points (5 - 9 FG) led Memphis's starters as the toll of playing through the Grizzlie's myriad injuries is showing. Memphis managed just 40 percent from the field and committed 14 turnovers against just 19 assists as the reserves continue to have trouble producing offense. Memphis has now shot better than 50 percent from the field just once in its past 16 games. The Grizzlies remain at home for a Wednesday matchup against Denver. The Spurs return home to host the Pelicans on Wednesday.

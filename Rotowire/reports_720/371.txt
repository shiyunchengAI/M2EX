The Dallas Mavericks proved to be too much to handle for the Sacramento Kings Tuesday night at the America Airlines Center, winning 106 - 98. The Kings got off to a fast start, led by Rudy Gay, accumulating a lead as high as 24 points in the first half. Dallas promptly responded though, battling back to cut the deficit to nine, as the buzzer sounded signifying the end of the second quarter. Gay tallied a line of 26 points (7 - 14 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 11 - 13 FT), eight rebounds, eight assists, and two steals while turning the ball over seven times. Monta Ellis was held scoreless in the first half, but was a huge factor in the second half finishing with 16 points (7 - 16 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 3 FT). Maverick's superstar Dirk Nowitzki registered a team - high 23 points (7 - 12 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), seven rebounds, three assists, and a block with two turnovers. The future hall of famer certainly did the heavy lifting Tuesday, against a Kings team looking to regain their form after a tough loss against the Oklahoma City Thunder Monday. Thursday, the Dallas Mavericks look ahead to their next game against the Philadelphia 76ers while the Sacramento Kings will go on the road Thursday to take on the Memphis Grizzlies in their next matchup.

The Milwaukee Bucks (14 - 13) defeated the Sacramento Kings (11 - 15) 108 - 107 on Thursday. Milwaukee played a wild card, starting rookie Johnny O'Bryant at power forward in just the second game of his career. O'Bryant earned the start with Larry Sanders sitting out with a one - game suspension, and with Jabari Parker (knee) recently ruled out for the season following a the suffering of a torn ACL in Monday's win over the Phoenix Suns. O'Bryant scored six points in 17 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo was questionable to play after he suffered a sprained ankle in Wednesday's loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, but his ankle appears to be no issue as he played 37 minutes, which far exceeds the 27 minutes per game he's averaged this season. Jared Dudley moved back to a bench role but still put up 19 points in 33 minutes. Sacramento got DeMarcus Cousins back from a ten - game absence due to a bout with viral meningitis. While it was expected that Cousins' minutes may be limited, the Kings let him play his usual compliment of 30 - plus minutes, in which time Cousins put up a game - high 27 points to go with 11 rebounds and five assists. Though the team installed Ty Corbin as their new head coach this week, they have not made any significant changes to their rotation through Corbin's first two games. Milwaukee will wrap up their four - game road trip Saturday in Los Angeles against the Clippers. Sacramento has dropped five straight games, but they'll have a good chance at breaking that streak when they host the Lakers on Sunday.

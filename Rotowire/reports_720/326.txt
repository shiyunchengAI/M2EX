The host Golden State Warriors blew out the injury - riddled Utah Jazz on Tuesday, 104 - 74. Golden State (25 - 4) remains the league's top team thanks to the win. The Warriors have now won five straight and sit atop the Western Conference, though San Antonio sits just one game back from the lead. On Tuesday, the sailing looked as smooth as ever for the Golden State "superteam," as former MVPs Steph Curry and Kevin Durant combined to score 47. All-Star forward Draymond Green, meanwhile, had 15 points and 11 assists, as well as five steals on the defensive end. All-Star Klay Thompson also had 17. The Jazz (18 - 11) had won four straight before being blown out on Tuesday. Utah remains hampered by major injuries, as starters George Hill and Derrick Favors were forced to sit out the game in Oakland. It was nothing short of an awful offensive performance for the depleted team, as the Jazz shot just 35 percent from the field and turned the ball over 23 times. Despite the team's intense struggles, big man Rudy Gobert continued to dominate, recording a game - high 16 rebounds and shooting 5 - of - 6 on the night. The Jazz will host the Kings on Wednesday, while Golden State will travel to Brooklyn to face the Nets on Thursday.

The Houston Rockets (56 - 26) concluded the regular season with an 117 - 91 win over the Utah Jazz (38 - 44). The Rockets jumped out to a 65 - 35 halftime lead. They clinched the two seed in the Western Conference following the San Antonio Spurs’ loss to the New Orleans Pelicans and will face the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. James Harden conceded the scoring title to the Thunders’ Russell Westbrook, but did his best Westbrook imitation by securing a triple - double in fewer than 28 minutes. The potential Most Valuable Player recipient provided 16 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, one steal, one block and two three - pointers. Aside from finishing second in scoring, Harden’s 2 steals per game was fifth best in the league. Dwight Howard returned to the lineup after sitting out the previous game, accumulating 14 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes. The Rockets hit 12 more three - pointers, extending their single - season NBA record to 921 makes from downtown. Derrick Favors made a brief appearance after missing the previous two games due to back problems. He finagled four points in nine minutes to close out his best season as a pro. Gordon Hayward and Trevor Booker were given the night off, and coach Quin Snyder ran a 10 - man rotation. Rudy Gobert made one last push for Most Improved Player and Defensive Player of the Year awards, notching three blocks and one steal in 24 minutes. He finished the year with 2 blocks per game, third best among qualifiers. The Jazz ended the season with the 11th worst record in the league after posting a 19 - 10 mark after the All-Star break.

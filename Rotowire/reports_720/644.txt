The Atlanta Hawks went on the road and defeated the Indiana Pacers 96 - 85 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse on Wednesday. The Hawks (10 - 5) were at risk of losing their fourth straight game heading into Wednesday, but Dwight Howard was not going to let that happen. The big man put on a Superman-like performance, notching 23 points and 20 rebounds in 33 minutes. It was his 11th double - double of the season and his first 20 - point, 20 - rebound game. His partner in the frontcourt, Paul Millsap, had a double - double of his own Wednesday night, posting 18 points and 11 rebounds - - his fifth double - double of the season. In the end, the game was won on the boards for Atlanta, as they out - rebounded the Pacers (7 - 9) by 19, 56 - 37. For Indiana, both Paul George and Myles Turner returned to the lineup after missing time with ankle injuries, but even that was n't enough to get past the Hawks. George put together a solid performance, recording 18 points and six rebounds, but shot a poor 6 - of - 22 from the field and 2 - of - 11 from behind the arc. Turner could n't get anything going on the offensive end, posting just seven points on top of nine rebounds in his return. It was Thaddeus Young who ended up leading the way for the Pacers, posting a game - high 24 points on 10 - of - 13 shooting and seven rebounds in 41 minutes. Up next, the Hawks will head to Utah on Friday to take on the Jazz, while the Pacers will stay home Friday to play the Nets.

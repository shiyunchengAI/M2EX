With much fanfare being made about the absurd statistical starts of many superstars, Damian Lillard continued to separate himself from the pack on Friday night. Through six games, Lillard is averaging just over 34 points on over 52 percent shooting. Friday's 42 - point outing marked his highest scoring night of the season, though that was a high bar for Lillard to hop; in six games, he has scored no lower than 27 and has eclipsed 35 points three times. For Dallas, meanwhile, offseason addition Harrison Barnes has seen his role shift with the Mavericks. After playing in a loaded Golden State offense, Barnes has been able to see the ball in his hands plenty in Dallas. With 17 points on Friday, Barnes remains Dallas's top scorer, having reached double digits in all five games thus far.

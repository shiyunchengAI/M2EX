The Charlotte Hornets (23 - 25) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (9 - 41) 101 - 82 at Staples Center on Sunday. As the halfway point of the season has passed, and the upcoming all - star break is around the corner, the Lakers will likely look to start thinking about 2016 - 2017 and the NBA Draft because it was the same story with Los Angeles, who picked up their 10th straight loss and dropped to 4 - 24 at home. Kobe Bryant played to the delight of the hometown crowd, and provided one of his better performances of the season, as he finished with 23 points, eight rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 18 shooting in 23 minutes. The rout was on early for Charlotte, who stretched a double figure lead and danced around a 30 point blowout for most of the second half. The Lakers turned the ball over 15 times and Charlotte exploited the youthful Los Angeles roster, specifically D’Angelo Russell, who converted five of the team's turnovers. Russell contributed 10 points, six rebounds and one assist off the bench. Julius Randle strung together another double - double with 10 points and 11 rebounds, while his frontcourt partner, Roy Hibbert, finished with zero points and two boards in a weak showing from the veteran. Kemba Walker’s torrid shooting did not have a large impact on the Hornets all around effort, as the frontcourt combination of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who made his season debut on Friday against the Blazers, and Marvin Williams contributed 38 points and 24 rebounds. Even more impressively, they combined to go 6 - of - 10 from behind the arc, which constantly kept the game far out of reach from the Lakers. Nobody else on the Hornets was nearly as polarizing as the two forwards, but a bright spot came from rookie Frank Kaminsky, who finished with 11 points in 23 minutes off the bench. The Lakers will host the Minnesota Timberwolves (14 - 35) on Tuesday, while the Hornets will entertain LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers (34 - 12) on Wednesday.

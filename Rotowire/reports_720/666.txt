The Cleveland Cavaliers (32 - 12) extended their lead on the Eastern Conference with a 115 - 93 home win over the plummeting Phoenix Suns (14 - 33). In their third game since firing coach David Blatt, the Cavs ran circles around the struggling Suns on both ends of the floor. Cleveland shot a whopping 56 percent from the field while sinking 11 three - pointers and simultaneously forcing 22 Phoenix turnovers. The team recorded an impressive 34 total assists, including nine from star LeBron James. In addition to his role as distributor, LeBron scored a highly efficient 21 points on 7 for 8 shooting from the field and 7 of 7 at the line. Power forward Kevin Love, who has been the subject of many trade rumors of late, also posted 21 points along with 11 rebounds, four assists, two steals, and two blocks. Phoenix has been struggling mightily lately, winning just two of its last 19 games. With star point guard Eric Bledsoe out for the season due to a torn meniscus, the Suns have given the reigns to their young core of players. Rookie Devin Booker has shone in a starting role, and Wednesday was no exception. Booker posted 16 points, three rebounds, and five assists, and turned the ball over just twice in 34 minutes. The Suns will have a day off before traveling to Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks on Friday night. The Cavs, meanwhile, visit Central-Division foe Detroit on Friday.

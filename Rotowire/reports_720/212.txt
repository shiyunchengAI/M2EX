Kevin Durant's 29 - point first half is easily his best performance of the season, but it's even better when you consider he single - handedly outscored the Thunder in the second quarter. The 39 points was a season - high and the seven made threes tied a career - high. While Draymond Green and Zaza Pachulia failed to reach double figures in scoring, their combined 20 rebounds, three steals and seven blocks played a huge factor on the other end of the floor. Despite leading the team with 21 points, Victor Oladipo provided just three rebounds, no assists and no steals or blocks in the blowout loss. That led to his - 25 plus - minus, which was one of the worst for the game. Enes Kanter talked a lot to Durant during the loss, but did almost all of it from the bench. In fact, he failed to score or rebound and played just three minutes in the defeat. Things should get better for the Thunder though, as they start a five - game homestand on Saturday and play three teams in that stretch expected to finish below .500. The Warriors also have a nice five - game stretch approaching, as their next five games come against teams who failed to miss the playoffs last season.

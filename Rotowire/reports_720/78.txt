These are two teams going in opposite directions, but Dallas showed some resiliency here with a road win. Harrison Barnes continues to develop as a go - to guy, as he has 65 points across his last two games. J.J. Barea has been equally as good, as he has at least 18 points and five assists across his last three games. Seth Curry's 23 points were a season - high, as he got plenty of run with Deron Williams out of the lineup. Luol Deng continues to struggle, as he's failed to surpass seven points or seven rebound over his last three games. Lou Williams continued his run at a coveted sixth - man award, as his 15 points marked his fifth - straight game with at least 14 points scored. Jordan Clarkson scored his 22 points on just 12 shots, as he went 9 - of - 12 from the field. These two teams will have a rematch on December 29 back in Los Angeles.

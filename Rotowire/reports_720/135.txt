James Harden scored 34 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome a fourth quarter run by Golden State, as the Rockets fell 105 - 93 on Wednesday. Playing without Dwight Howard, as well as a number of other key reserves, Houston shot 42 percent from the floor and 9 - of - 35 from beyond the arc. The offense relied heavily on Harden, who converted 14 - of - 27 field goals and 3 - of - 8 three - pointers to go with eight rebounds, four assists and four steals. Patrick Beverley added 12 points, while Donatas Motiejunas and Trevor Ariza (5 - 14 FG, 4 - 12 3Pt) each had 18. Golden State, winners of 14 straight, maintained its grasp on the league’s best record behind 20 points, seven rebounds and seven assists from Stephen Curry. Klay Thompson added 21 points despite converting just 1 - of - 8 three - point attempts, and Harrison Barnes chipped in 20 points and seven rebounds of his own. Starting in place of the injured Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli had seven points and three rebounds in 16 minutes. The road ahead doesn’t get any easier for Golden State, which takes on the Mavericks on Saturday. Following that matchup, New Orleans, Memphis, Oklahoma City and Sacramento await on the schedule. Houston, meanwhile, plays in Sacramento Thursday night. Howard is not expected to play and hopes to return for Saturday’s game against Denver.

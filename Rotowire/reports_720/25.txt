The Memphis Grizzlies (18 - 16) defeated the Miami Heat (18 - 13) 99 - 90 in overtime at the FedExForum in Memphis on Tuesday. It looked like the Grizzlies were going to close this game out in regulation, but the Heat finished on an 11 - 2 run to force overtime. Memphis didn’t panic, exploding for 16 points in the extra session to pull away from the scrappy visitors. Free throw shooting proved to be the difference in the contest, as the Heat went just 9 - for - 18 from the charity stripe while the hosts were nearly perfect at 19 - for - 20. The Grizzlies used a balanced team effort to pick up the victory, with four starters scoring at least 16 points. Marc Gasol came up hobbling after stepping on the foot of Heat point guard Goran Dragic in overtime, but showed no ill effects as he stayed in the game and ultimately finished with a team - leading 23 points, eight rebounds, six assists and four blocks. Zach Randolph added 17 points on efficient 7 - for - 10 shooting, while Jeff Green and Mike Conley both finished with 16 points. For the Heat, Chris Bosh led the team with 22 points, but was held scoreless after the third quarter while going 0 - for - 7 from the field down the stretch. Dwyane Wade contributed 19 points, five assists and five rebounds, and Hassan Whiteside scored five points and pulled down a game - high 11 rebounds in 37 minutes before fouling out in overtime. Miami’s next game will come at home against the Mavericks on Friday, while Memphis opens a three - game road trip in Utah on Saturday.

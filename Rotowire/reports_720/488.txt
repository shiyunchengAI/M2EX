The Houston Rockets (60) defeated the San Antonio Spurs (2 - 2) 98 - 81 on Thursday. As he's done several times every season over the past few years, coach Gregg Popovich opted to rest several of his players Thursday. It was a planned day of rest for Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, and they were joined on the bench by Marco Belinelli, who injured his groin in Wednesday's game, and Tiago Splitter, who tried to return to action Wednesday but had to leave do to a flair up of his calf issue. The Spurs were resigned to starting Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Matt Bonner, and Aron Baynes against Dwight Howard and James Harden. Howard had his best game of the season, posting 32 points and 16 rebounds in 33 minutes. Harden put up 20 points to go with six rebounds, six assists, and three blocks in 33 minutes, doing himself well in what appears to be a season he'll be making a bid for both the scoring championship and the MVP Award. Patrick Beverley was held out to rest his hamstring injury, and Isaiah Canaan filled in as the starting point guard, a distinction Canaan has performed well in for three of the Rockets' last four games, where Beverley has been absent due to injury. The Spurs' next game is at home Saturday against the New Orleans Pelicans. The Rockets will host the Golden State Warriors on Saturday.

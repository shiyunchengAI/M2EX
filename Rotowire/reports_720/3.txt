The Wizards launched yet another comeback on Tuesday, this time feasting on the relatively inexperienced Los Angeles Lakers. Washington not only overcame a 13 - point fourth quarter deficit, but won by double digits as well. The team shot over 51 percent from the field on the night and outscored LA 37 - 13 in the fourth. At the crux of the win was All-Star point guard John Wall, who scored 34 points to go along with 14 assists and four steals. Wall was an excellent 14 - of - 25 from the field. LA, meanwhile, saw promising play from its own point guard. Sophomore D'Angelo Russell filled the stat sheet respectably, shooting 10 - of - 21 for 28 points to go along with nine assists and six rebounds. His backcourt partner, Jordan Clarkson, added another 22 points and shot 10 - of - 19.

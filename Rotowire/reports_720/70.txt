The Orlando Magic (25 - 53) defeated the Chicago Bulls (46 - 32) 105 - 103 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando. Down two with just over six seconds left in the game, it was Pau Gasol who was able to force his way to the free throw line and hit a pair of free throws to tie the game up. Victor Oladipo then came up clutch for the Magic, driving for a layup with just a second left in the game, therefore giving them a two point lead and eventually the victory. With the loss, the Bulls move into a tie with the Toronto Raptors for the third projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. With just four games left in the regular season, it will be a battle for future playoff positioning from here on out. The Magic were superior shooters in this one, going 46 percent from the field, while the Bulls finished at 43 percent. It was Oladipo that led the way for the Magic. Along with making the game - winning layup, Oladipo had 23 points (8 - 14 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT), five assists and three steals over 41 minutes. After shooting less than 35 percent from the field in his two previous games, Oladipo got back on track a bit Wednesday with his shot, finishing at 46 percent. Nikola Vucevic played a big factor in the win as well, posting 22 points (9 - 16 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and seven rebounds. He continues to be one of the more consistent players on this team, as he's averaging 26 points and 10 rebounds over his last three games. The third starter in double figures was Elfrid Payton, who nearly recorded a triple - double with 17 points (6 - 14 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT), nine rebounds and nine assists. He's been doing a little bit of everything for this team, averaging 13 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists and 3 steals in his last four games. Jimmy Butler did his best to keep the Bulls in this game, going 6 - for - 10 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 19 points, while also adding six assists and two steals. He's now pushed his season averages to 20 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists per game. Pau Gasol did n't have the best day shooting the ball, but got to the free throw line a bunch to record 15 points (4 - 10 FG, 7 - 9 FT), nine rebounds and three blocked shots. Over his last three games, he's now averaging 18 point and 9 rebounds, but he'll need to do even better if the Bulls want to make a run in the playoffs. The Bulls also had some solid contributions from their bench. Taj Gibson recorded an efficient 15 points (6 - 12 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds, while Nikola Mirotic added 15 points (3 - 11 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT) of his own over 27 minutes.

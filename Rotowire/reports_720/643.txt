The Boston Celtics (44 - 32) shocked the Golden State Warriors (68 - 8) in a 109 - 106 win on Friday. The loss snapped the Warriors' NBA-record 54 consecutive home winnning streak. The key for Boston was its defense, as it held the Warriors to 46 percent shooting and forced 22 turnovers. The Celtics shot 47 percent from the field, despite hitting only 63 percent of their free - throws. Boston has quietly been one of the best teams in the league this season, but they're not so hidden anymore. Evan Turner filled in for Jae Crowder and tallied 21 points, five rebounds, five assists and three steals in a great performance. Isaiah Thomas led the team with 22 points, while also dishing out six assists, Jared Sullinger was huge down low, as he amassed 21 points and 12 rebounds. Up next for the Celtics is a matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. Golden State is now a 5 - 1 stretch away from breaking the record for wins in a season, so this was obviously a huge blow for that pursuit. Steph Curry scored 22 points in the third quarter, but really struggled aside from that. In fact, Curry had just seven points in the other three quarters and committed nine turnovers in the defeat. Draymond Green had another great all - around game though, as he accumulated 16 points, nine rebounds, seven assists and six steals. On deck for the Warriors is a matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday.

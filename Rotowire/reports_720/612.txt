The San Antonio Spurs (28 - 6) remain undefeated at home, now 190, after they dismantled the hurting Phoenix Suns (12 - 22), 112 - 79, on Wednesday. This was the Suns sixth loss in a row, while San Antonio picked up their third win in a row. Given the Spurs undefeated home record and the poor play, injuries and drama surrounding the Suns, this game was pretty much over before it started. However, the disciplined Spurs made sure to take nothing for granted, as they got up to a 32 - 12 lead by the end of the first quarter. The Suns never had another chance. The Suns were again without their top scorer, Eric Bledsoe, who is out with a torn meniscus. In his absence no one was able to step up offensively. The Suns had three players score 11 points and no one else break 10. Tyson Chandler scored 11 points (5 - 6 FG) and pulled down 10 rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench. Brandon Knight also had 11 points, along with four assists, in 26 minutes. T.J. Warren chipped in 11 points (5 - 10 FG) as well. The Suns shot 39 percent from the field as a team. Tim Duncan sat this one out with a sore right knee but there was no shortage of teammates to step up in his absence, as 12 of the 13 players that hit the floor for the Spurs scored points. LaMarcus Aldridge played 29 minutes and led the way in scoring and rebounds for his team, with a double - double consisting of 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 5 - 10 FT) and 12 rebounds. Kawhi Leonard finished with a cool 19 points (6 - 10 FG, 3 - 4 4Pt, 4 - 4 FT), along with two assists and two steals, also in 29 minutes. Tony Parker had a complete game, with 12 points (5 - 8 FG), seven assists, four steals, three rebounds and only one turnover, in 22 minutes. The Spurs shot a blistering 56 percent from the field, including 6 - 14 from beyond the arc. The Spurs will now get a couple of days rest before hosting state - rival Houston Rockets on Saturday. The Suns will enter the second game of a four - game road trip, as well as the second of a back - to - back, when they play in Oklahoma City, on Thursday night.

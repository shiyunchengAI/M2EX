The Boston Celtics (31 - 22) earned a home win Sunday over the Sacramento Kings (21 - 30) at TD Garden, 128 - 119. Sacramento scored the game's first four points, but the Celtics immediately rattled off a 90 run to take a lead they never relinquished. Boston scored 46 points in a frantic first quarter and was brilliant offensively all day, as they shot a sharp 56 percent from the field and 55 percent from three. Boston's starting backcourt powered the Celtics offense, as Avery Bradley led the team with 25 points (9 - 16 FG, 6 - 7 3PT) and Isaiah Thomas (8 - 18 FG) added 22. Jared Sullinger (10 - 13 FG, 21 points) and Tyler Zeller (6 - 8 FG, 17 points) gave Boston an efficient inside attack as well. DeMarcus Cousins led the Kings with a game - high 31 points and added seven rebounds and six assists. Rajon Rondo scored 14 points and dished 15 assists and Willie Cauley-Stein scored 15 behind sharp 7 - 9 shooting from the field. But the Kings had no defensive answer for Boston and their brilliant shooting night. Boston will take to the road for a matchup Tuesday in Milwaukee. Sacramento's road trip continues Monday against Cleveland.

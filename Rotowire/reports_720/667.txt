The Cavaliers (19 - 7) held off the Knicks (14 - 16) for a 91 - 84 victory at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday. The Knicks fought tough, but were unable to handle the Cavaliers stifling defense, particularly in the fourth quarter in which New York managed just 12 points. Iman Shumpert did an excellent job defending locking down Aaron Afflalo, while LeBron James and Kevin Love each poured in 23 points. Cleveland padded its lead in the Eastern Conference standings with a sixth straight win - - the Cavaliers longest winning streak of the season was eight games earlier in the season. It was a solid effort from the Knicks without All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony, who was sidelined due to an ankle injury, thought he was expected to play earlier in the day after shootaround. In Anthony's stead, New York turned to rookie Kristaps Porzingus, who poured in a team - high 23 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting to go along with 13 rebounds. It was a nice bounce - back game for Porzingus, as the young big man had n't scored more than 20 points since Dec. 7 against the Mavericks. He also set a new career high with four 3 - pointers made. The Cavaliers received a big boost with Kyrie Irving returning to the lineup Sunday against the 76ers, but the superstar point guard has n't been very effective. He played just 19 minutes Wednesday and was limited to five points on 1 - of - 7 shooting from the field. It's still only been two games since Irving's return, so chances are he'll need a few more contests to get back into the swing of things, which the Cavaliers can certainly afford considering how well they've played lately. Tristan Thompson posted his fifth double - double of the season with 10 points and 14 rebounds.

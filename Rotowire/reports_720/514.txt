The Orlando Magic defeated the host Oklahoma City Thunder 119 - 117 at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday. In a game full of revenge narratives, Serge Ibaka had the last laugh. The former Oklahoma City product dropped a career - high 31 points and hit the game - winning basket with 0 seconds left. Orlando actually had a 21 - point lead in the first half, before Oklahoma City went on a 17 - 2 run in the third quarter to make it a game. Both teams shot well, as they each eclipsed 50 percent from the field. Three-point shooting was the big disparity, as the Magic went 11 - of - 24, while the Thunder went 7 - of - 25. The Thunder really hurt themselves at the free - throw line as well, going 16 - of - 26 in the defeat. Orlando (4 - 6) had the worst offense in the league coming into this game, so a 119 - point performance is just what the doctor ordered. Ibaka was the hero though, as he punished his former team with a career - high 31 points, nine rebounds and four blocks on 13 - of - 19 shooting. Elfrid Payton had his best game of the season as well, accumulating 23 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. Evan Fournier provided 21 points of his own on 7 - of - 10 shooting. Aaron Gordon and D.J. Augustin scored 12 a piece off the bench. The Magic's next game will be on Monday against the Indiana Pacers. Oklahoma City (6 - 4) has lived off Russell Westbrook's absurd production and he gave them yet another stellar performance here. Westbrook tallied 41 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists en route to another triple - double. Steven Adams recorded a double - double of his own, totaling 13 points and 10 rebounds. Victor Oladipo also played a revenge game against his former team, but scored just 12 points on an efficient 6 - of - 9 from the field. Enes Kanter scored 16 points and grabbed eight boards off the bench. Oklahoma City will be in action again on Monday, as they travel to face the Detroit Pistons.

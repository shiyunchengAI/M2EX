Before Tuesday night's game against the Magic, Trevor Ariza had been serving as an offensive liability for the Rockets. Over his previous eight games, he had failed to score in double figures six times and was shooting just 23 percent from the field and 24 percent from behind the arc over the course of those eight games. Against Orlando, however, Ariza found a way to shoot himself completely out of that slump. The wing shot 4 - of - 9 from behind the arc and 7 - of - 15 from the field overall to put in 20 points Tuesday - - his highest scoring total since Jan. 15. And while Ariza is primarily known for his prowess on the defensive end, if he can consistently hit a high percentage of his jump shots like he did Tuesday night, it only makes the Rockets more dangerous.

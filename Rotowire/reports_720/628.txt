The Miami Heat (24 - 31) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (12 - 44) 119 - 108 on Monday. The Heat are still reeling from the recent news that Chris Bosh will miss the remainder of the season with blood clots in his lung. Udonis Haslem started Monday at power forward in place of Bosh, playing 23 minutes with four points and seven rebounds. Luol Deng lit up the 76ers for 29 points on 11 - of - 14 shooting, which was his best scoring performance since dropping 30 on the Dallas Mavericks back on Nov. 9. Newly acquired point guard Goran Dragic had his first double - double in a Heat jersey, with 23 points and 10 assists. He's averaging 18 points and 6 assists in 33 minutes in two games since coming over in a deadline deal with the Phoenix Suns. Mario Chalmers, who was sent to the bench in favor of Dragic, posted nine points and six assists in 21 minutes. Hollis Thompson led all reserves with 22 points on the backs of 6 - for - 9 from beyond the arc. It was Thompson's second - highest scoring output of the season. Nerlens Noel also had his second - biggest outing of the season in terms of points, scoring 18 to go along with seven boards and four blocked shots. JaVale McGee, who came over in a trade from the Nuggets last week, is averaging just 3 points and 2 rebounds in 12 minutes in three contests since he was acquired. Philadelphia has dropped four straight games, and the only team looking up at them in the Eastern Conference standings are the lowly New York Knicks. The 76ers will travel to Milwaukee to take on the Bucks on Wednesday, in a what could be Michael Carter-Williams' (toe) Bucks debut against his former team. Meanwhile, the Heat will take on their division foe, the Magic, in Orlando on Wednesday.

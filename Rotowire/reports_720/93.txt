The Chicago Bulls (34 - 20) handled the Cleveland Cavaliers (33 - 22), 113 - 98, on Thursday. Chicago enters the All-Star break with a four - game winning streak in hand, during which they held each opponent below 100 points. On the backs of five players achieving double - digit points, the Bulls outscored the Cavaliers in each quarter, yet remain behind in the season series, 1 - 2. Derrick Rose led the way with 30 points, marking just the fourth time this season he's surpassed that threshold. In the frontcourt, both Pau Gasol (18 points and 10 rebounds) and Joakim Noah (10 points and 15 boards) tallied double - doubles, with the Spaniard notching his 14th in row. Meanwhile, Tony Snell garnered his third starting nod in six contests due to the absences of Jimmy Butler (shoulder) and Kirk Hinrich (toe), and the second - year pro responded with 22 points and a game - high four three - pointers in 38 minutes. Once Chicago returns from their midseason respite, the Detroit Pistons await on Friday, Feb. 20 in the Palace of Auburn Hills. Thursday's defeat doubles as Cleveland's second in four outings, but LeBron James did everything in his power to keep the deficit somewhat close, accruing 31 points, five rebounds, and four assists. However, with Kevin Love out of commission as a result of a corneal abrasion sustained during Wednesday's win against the Miami Heat, the road was all the more winding when 16 turnovers were transformed into 24 points for the Bulls. The Cavaliers' foibles on offense were compounded by miserable success from three - point range - - just 8 - for - 31, or 26 percent - - and subsequently, just three of James' teammates scored in double figures, including Kyrie Irving (17), Timofey Mozgov (13), and Tristan Thompson (10). After the break, Cleveland will embark upon a three - game road trip, tipping off first against the Washington Wizards on Friday, Feb. 20.

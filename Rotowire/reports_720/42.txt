The Toronto Raptors (31 - 15) defeated the Sacramento Kings (16 - 28) 119 - 102 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. While the game went into halftime tied 54 - 54, the Raptors came out firing in the third quarter, out - scoring the Kings 39 - 22 and allowing themselves to coast to a 17 - point victory at home in front of their crowd. The Raptors were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from the three - point line, while the Kings went 48 percent from the field and 41 percent from beyond the arc. With their fantastic shooting and rebounding advantage, the Raptors grabbed their fourth straight victory. The biggest contributor for the Raptors surprisingly came off the bench in Wednesday's matchup, as Louis Williams finished with a team - high of 27 points (7 - 16 FG, 4 - 12 3Pt, 9 - 9 FT), while also adding two assists and three steals in only 26 minutes. It was a very nice surprise for the Raptors, as he's only averaging 15 points per game so far this season. Greivis Vasquez shot well, going 7 - for - 9 from the field and 4 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also recording four rebounds and six assists. He's really struggled with his shot this season, so it was good to see him turn it around Wednesday. Coming just short of a double - double, Jonas Valanciunas recorded 15 points (6 - 10 FG, 3 - 3 FT) and nine rebounds. He's now averaging 13 points and 9 rebounds on the season. Neither Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan had too big of a night, but each still finished in double figures. Lowry had 13 points (5 - 12 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and seven assists, while DeRozan had 12 points (5 - 13 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 4 FT) and six assists. The Kings were led by Rudy Gay, who recorded 22 points (8 - 17 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT) and three assists. Despite Friday's zero point outing where he played only 13 minutes, Gay has now scored 22 points or more in his last four games. Ben McLemore went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding five rebounds. It was the most points he's scored since mid - December, so it was good to see him dial in his shot Wednesday. Having one of his least productive games in awhile, DeMarcus Cousins finished with only 13 points (5 - 10 FG, 3 - 4 FT), four rebounds and two blocked shots. He matched a season - high of nine turnovers as well, so he'll need to cut those down if the Kings want a chance at winning in the future. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday, while the Kings will travel to Cleveland to play the Cavaliers on Friday.

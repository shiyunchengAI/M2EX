The Portland Trail Blazers (33 - 16) narrowly avoided their fourth straight loss Tuesday, holding off a late charge from Utah to defeat the Jazz (17 - 31) 103 - 102. Portland had lost eight of its last ten games, including an 0 - 3 road trip last week, coming into Tuesday's contest and was desperate for a win. Utah hung tough with Portland and made things very interesting when Joe Ingles' three pointer brought the Jazz within two points with just under 10 seconds to go in the game. However, LaMarcus Aldridge's free throws put the game out of reach for the Jazz as Portland notched a much - needed win. Utah has been a thorn in the side for the West's top teams of late, coming within five points of the Clippers and securing a surprising win over Golden State last week. Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 27 points on 10 - of - 16 shooting. Dante Exum started at point guard again, but only logged 20 minutes on the floor and was held scoreless while Trey Burke put up 18 points in 34 minutes. Utah gets another top team in the West on Wednesday when Memphis comes to town. Portland's recent struggles have affected its playoff standing, but the Trail Blazers were able to pull off a victory to temporarily stop the bleeding. The Trail Blazers are one of four teams in the Western Conference with 33 wins now and need to right the ship if they want to keep their standing in the top four. Robin Lopez returned to the floor for the first time since mid - December and contributed 11 points and six rebounds. He suffered a facial laceration in the third quarter, but was able to return to the game. Portland is idle Wednesday before hosting Phoenix on Thursday.

Russell Westbrook put up yet another night of historic numbers in Friday's win over Denver. The All-Star recorded just the fourth 35 - point, 15 - assist, 10 - rebound game in NBA history, one of which already belonged to himself. Westbrook scored a game - high 36 points, had 18 assists, and pulled down 12 rebounds. The triple - double was Westbrook's sixth of the season, and his 18 assists were the NBA's single - game season high thus far. Westbrook brought his rebounding average up to 10 per game, leaving him just short of a triple - double average on the season. Westbrook's dominance helped contribute to Oklahoma City's 50 percent shooting both from the field and from beyond the arc. Denver, meanwhile, kept the game competitive through dominance on the boards. The Nuggets are the number one rebounding team in the NBA, and showed it with 51 rebounds against a strong OKC team. Forward Wilson Chandler led the offense with 30 points, while rookie Jamal Murray had 20 off the bench.

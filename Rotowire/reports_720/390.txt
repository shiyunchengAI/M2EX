The Pelicans (7 - 18) notched a rare road win Wednesday at the Vivint Smart Home Arena, 104 - 94 over the Utah Jazz (10 - 14). Down three to open the fourth quarter, the Pelicans completely stifled the Jazz down the stretch and allowed only __ fourth quarter points to run away with the game in the final minutes. The Pelicans got hot from three - point land, as they knocked down 10 of their 21 attempts, led by Eric Gordon's 4 - 7 shooting effort from deep. Gordon led Pelicans starters with 19 points, but the game's high scorer was Ryan Anderson off the bench with 24 points, fueled by a perfect 13 - 13 night from the free throw line. Anthony Davis scored 17 on 7 - 15 shooting and ripped down a game high 13 rebounds to complete his third double - double in the past four games. Derrick Favors paced the Jazz with 22 points on an efficient 10 - 15 shooting night. Gordon Hayward added 20 points and shot 3 - 7 from three - point land. Trey Burke led all Jazz bench sscorers with 12 points, and he dished out five assists. The Jazz just could n't get out in transition, as they scored just six fast break points, and they could n't generate second chances either, as they managed only five offensive rebounds. The Pelicans will look to win consecutive games for the first time since November with their next contest Friday night in Phoenix. The Jazz have now lost four straight and will look to reverse things at home Friday night against the Nuggets.

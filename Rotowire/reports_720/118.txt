With double - digit scoring performances from all five starters, the Milwaukee Bucks (28 - 38) took down the New Orleans Pelicans (24 - 41) on Saturday, 103 - 92. Guard Khris Middleton neared a triple - double on Saturday, dropping 19 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists while also snagging three steals on the defensive end. Middleton went cold from deep, missing all four of his three - point attempts, but still managed to go an efficient 9 - for - 16 from the field. Red-hot sophomore Jabari Parker also grabbed three steals, while also scoring 15 points and pulling down five rebounds. The team as a whole shot an impressive 49 percent from the field while playing outstanding defense, holding the Pelicans to 39 percent shooting on the night. New Orleans could n't seal the deal despite 29 points and 11 rebounds from star Anthony Davis. While Davis had 29, the rest of the starting five scored just 30 total points, and the bench also saw struggles. Sixth man Jrue Holiday scored just eight points in 29 minutes while turning the ball over seven times. The team struggled mightily from deep, hitting just 21 percent of their three - pointers. New Orleans will face the Golden State Warriors on Monday, while the Bucks will take on the Nets on Sunday.

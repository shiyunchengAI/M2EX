The Toronto Raptors (36 - 17) defeated the Washington Wizards (33 - 21) 95 - 93 on Wednesday at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. With just under 13 seconds left in the game, DeMar DeRozan was able to hit a jump shot, putting the Raptors up by two. On the Wizards next posession, John Wall attempted to drive to the hoop, but got blocked by Kyle Lowry. The Wizards got the ball back after the block, and Wall had one more shot to win the game, but he missed a three - pointer at the buzzer, giving the Raptors the close two - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the Wizards (46 percent) shot better than the Raptors from the field (41 percent), the Raptors took the advantage from the three - point line, going 42 percent from deep, while the Wizards went just 24 percent. Along with the go - ahead bucket that helped give the Raptors a victory, DeRozan also posted 23 points (6 - 18 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 10 - 10 FT), three rebounds and three steals in the victory. He's on an impressive stretch of three games where he's averaging 22 points, five rebounds and 3 steals per game. The Raptors also received a huge contribution off the bench, as Louis Williams went 8 - for - 16 from the field and 4 - for - 8 from the three - point line to score 27 points in 33 minutes. It was a nice turn of events for him, after going scoreless in Sunday's game against the Spurs. He's now averaging 15 points on the season. Along with the block of Wall in the final seconds, Lowry also added 13 points (5 - 12 FG, 3 - 7 3Pt), four rebounds and six assists. His points totals were down, but with DeRozan and Williams playing so well, he did n't have to do as much offensively. Greivis Vasquez recorded 11 points (4 - 7 FG, 3 - 5 3PT) in just 18 minutes as well. John Wall led the team for the Wizards, but just could n't come up clutch in the final moments. He finished with 21 points (7 - 15 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 8 FT), four rebounds and eight assists. He shot only 30 percent (3 - 10 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Magic, so it was nice to see some improvement with his shot. Paul Pierce also played a factor, going 7 - for - 12 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 17 points. After combining for just eight points over his last two games, he was much more efficient with his time Wednesday. Nene had a solid showing, posting 14 points (7 - 8 FG, 0 - 2 FT), four rebounds and four steals. It was his second straight night with 14 points, while the four steals matched a season - high. The high scorer off the bench was Drew Gooden, who notched a double - double with 10 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt) and 12 rebounds. The Wizards' next game will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday after the All-Star break, while the Raptors will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Friday after the All-Star break as well.

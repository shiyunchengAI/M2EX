The Pistons utilized a balanced offensive attack and a stingy defense to record their first road victory against the Nuggets. All five members of the starting five reached double - digit scoring, led by Tobias Harris' 19 points. The remainder of the first unit, Marcus Morris, Andre Drummond, Ish Smith and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, combined for another 55 points, while Jon Leuer posted a 14 - point, 10 - rebound double - double off the bench. All of the strong offensive performances led to a 51 percent success rate from the field for Detroit. The Nuggets received double - digit scoring efforts from Danilo Gallinari, Emmanuel Mudiay and Gary Harris, but also saw Jusuf Nurkic held scoreless over 17 minutes. Jameer Nelson was the only bench player to hit double digits in the scoring column, although forward Wilson Chandler did manage to haul in 10 rebounds.

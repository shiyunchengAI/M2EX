While the Lakers have been struggling after their shockingly impressive start to the regular season, there is a silver lining in the form of rookie forward Brandon Ingram. The rookie struggled to acquiesce to the speed and strength of the NBA to start his career, but since the start of the new year, Ingram has begun to produce on a consistent level. After his 11 - point performance Tuesday against the Trail Blazers, Ingram is now averaging 14 points over his last four games and has scored in double - digits in each of those contests. Additionally, he has now shot at least 50 percent from the field in five straight games. This stretch comes after Ingram reached double - digit scoring in just eight games all season, as it appears the rookie is growing more and more comfortable in the big leagues with every game played.

The Chicago Bulls (38 - 23) defeated the Washington Wizards 104 - 96 (24 - 27) on Tuesday in Chicago. The Bulls, despite dealing with injuries to Derrick Rose (knee), Jimmy Butler (elbow), and Taj Gibson (ankle), were able to pull out a win against a struggling Wizards team. The Bulls were led by rookie Nikola Mirotic, who had a game - high 23 points on 6 - of - 13 shooting and eight rebounds in 32 minutes off the bench. In his last two games, Mirotic has totaled 52 points and 17 rebounds and has proven to be a viable option off the bench in place of Gibson. Chicago's starting frontcourt of Paul Gasol and Joakim Noah each posted double - doubles. Gasol had 20 points on 8 - of - 11 shooting and 10 rebounds, while Noah recorded 14 points on 4 - of - 5 shooting and 12 rebounds. Aaron Brooks got the start in place of Rose and while he shot an unimpressive 8 - of - 23 from the field, Brooks still finished with 22 points and eight assists in 35 minutes. Tony Snell got the start for Butler but posted just 11 points on 4 - of - 12 shooting in 40 minutes. The Bulls shot 42 percent from the field and had 16 turnovers to just 20 assists. John Wall struggled shooting the ball (8 - of - 20 from the field) but still managed to put up 21 points, 11 assists and four rebounds in 39 minutes. Marcin Gortat recorded 12 points on 6 - of - 9 shooting and 12 rebounds. The effort was his second straight double - double and his sixth straight game with double - digit rebounds. Paul Pierce (16), Bradley Beal (13), and Otto Poter Jr. (11) rounded out the Washington players in double figures. As a team, the Wizards shot 42 percent from the field and were active defensively, recording 11 blocks and 10 steals.

There is no doubt Giannis Antetokounmpo is having an All-Star season with the numbers he has been producing, as Monday's 22 - point, 11 - rebound performance was his eighth double - double of the season and brought his season averages to 22 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists per game. But perhaps the most overlooked stat of Antetokounmpo's breakout season is his steal totals, which, after recording two in Monday's loss to San Antonio, is now up to 2 per game. The Greek Freak has now managed to record at least two steals in his last four games and in five of his last seven. He has also had five games this season where he has gotten at least four steals and is currently behind only Chris Paul for the NBA lead in steals per game. So, while all eyes are on Antetokounmpo's ability to fill up the box score on the offensive end, he is turning out to be just as effective of a player on the other side of the ball as well.

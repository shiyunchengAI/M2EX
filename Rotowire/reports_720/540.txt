The Bulls (23 - 10) held off the Denver Nuggets (13 - 20) on Thursday by a score of 106 - 101. The Nuggets saw a seemingly comfortable 12 - point lead in the third quarter evaporate as the Bulls stormed back to take the lead just before the fourth quarter began. Denver's Aaron Afflalo cut Chicago's lead to five with just over two minutes remaining, but the Bulls responded with baskets from Derrick Rose and Taj Gibson to give them a solid lead. Chicago's Jimmy Butler shined again as he had a game - high 26 points in the Bulls' victory over the Nuggets. Denver had two of their big men banged up on Tuesday night as Kenneth Fareid and Wilson Chandler both were hampered by leg issues, but both managed to play Thursday. Fareid, who had "dead legs" Tuesday night did n't show any ill effects against the Bulls as he scored 18 points and pulled down 19 rebounds. Chandler led the Nuggets in scoring with 22 points in 34 minutes on the floor. Denver has now dropped three straight and five of its last six but will look to buck that trend it hosts Memphis on Saturday night. Kirk Hinrich returned to action for Chicago after missing five games with a hamstring injury. He was a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the floor, including 2 - for - 2 from beyond the arc as he scored 10 points in 27 minutes. Chicago has now won eight of its last nine games and will continue its five - game homestand on Saturday when the Bulls take on the Celtics.

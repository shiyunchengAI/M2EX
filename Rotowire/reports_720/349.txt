The Atlanta Hawks (51 - 14) defeated the Phoenix Suns (34 - 33) 96 - 87 on Friday at the US Airways Center in Phoenix. Despite coming out of the third quarter down 73 - 65, the Hawks lit it up in the fourth, out - scoring the Suns 31 - 14 to finish the game and steal the nine - point victory on the road in Phoenix. It's a tough loss for the Suns, as that marks their fifth loss over their last ten games. It also pushes them three games behind the Oklahoma City Thunder and New Orleans Pelicans, who sit tied for the eigth and final projected playoff seed in the Western Coference standings. The Hawks, on the other hand, only furthered their already comfortable lead atop the Eastern Conference standings. They now sit 10 games ahead of LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers for the first overall seed. Paul Millsap was a big reason for the Hawks' success. He went 10 - for - 18 from the field and 3 - for - 6 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 23 points, while also adding nine rebounds, three steals and three blocked shots. He's been very impressive on the defensive side of the ball lately, finishing with two or more steals in each of his last six games. He's pushed his season averages to 17 points, 8 rebounds and three assists. Kyle Korver also played a big factor in the win, finishing with 14 points (5 - for - 8 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), four rebounds and two blocked shots. He has been unbelievable shooting the ball over his last three games, combining to go 18 - for - 25 from the field and 14 - for - 19 from the three - point line to score 52 points. Coming close to a double - double, Al Horford added 12 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 2 FT) and seven rebounds in 34 minutes. He dominated Alex len in the post, not only scoring some points on him, but keeping Len scoreless himself in 24 minutes. Both Dennis Schroder and Kent Bazemore reached double figures off the bench with 11 points apiece. While their bench combined for only 15 points, the Suns' starters did plenty of scoring. The Morris twins formed a solid duo at the forward positions. Markieff Morris finished with 22 points (9 - 18 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 5 FT), six rebounds and five steals, while Marcus Morris posted 18 points (7 - 18 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and six rebounds. Markieff has posted two impressive games in a row, combining for 46 points on 19 - of - 33 shooting from the field. Marcus was in the starting lineup, as P.J. Tucker shifted down to a guard position with Brandon Knight sitting out with an ankle injury. Eric Bledsoe did his best to make up for the loss of Knight as well. He went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 21 points, to go along with six assists. He did have seven turnovers though, as he was a little sloppy in the loss. Tucker added 11 points (4 - 9 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine rebounds. The Hawks' next game will be on the road against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday, while the Suns will be at home against the New York Knicks on Sunday.

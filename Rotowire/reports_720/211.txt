The host Orlando Magic defeated the Dallas Mavericks, 97 - 87, at Amway Center on Saturday. In a battle between two inept offenses, the Magic were able to prevail with a much - needed victory. They took care of business late, as the Magic outscored the Mavericks 31 - 18 in the fourth quarter. Defense was key for Orlando, as they held Dallas to 34 percent shooting from the field and dominated the rebounding, 50 - 34. The Magic not only controlled the paint through rebounding, as they outscored Dallas 32 - 16 in the paint as well. No team led by more than nine points, as this was tightly - contested throughout. Dallas (2 - 10) is in a historically bad stretch offensively right now and a 34 percent night just adds to those struggles. Newly-acquired, Jonathan Gibson, was the Mavericks best player, as he tallied 26 points, six rebounds and three assists off the bench. Wesley Matthews and Seth Curry led the starters in scoring, as they scored 13 apiece. Harrison Barnes went just 3 - of - 13 from the field, en route to an 11 - point night. The offensive struggles are likely to continue, as they travel to San Antonio on Monday to face the Spurs for their next game. Orlando (6 - 7) has been just as bad on offense as Dallas, but they were able to win here thanks to some elite defense. D.J. Augustin led the team in scoring, totaling 18 points and six assists off the bench. Serge Ibaka was second in scoring, tallying 15 points, nine rebounds and three blocks in the win. Nikola Vucevic amassed 12 points and 12 rebounds, despite going 5 - of - 16 from the field. Bismack Biyombo recorded a double - double off the bench, accruing 13 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in the win. Orlando will look to keep rolling, as they travel to Milwaukee on Monday to face the Bucks.

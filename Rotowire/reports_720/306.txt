The Dallas Mavericks (38 - 20) defeated the Charlotte Hornets (22 - 32) 92 - 81 on Sunday. With the win, the Mavericks swept the season series against the Hornets 20. Dallas has played three games already since the All-Star break ended, losing Thursday's game to the Thunder before taking home wins on Friday and Sunday. Chandler Parsons sat out with a sprained ankle and bone bruise against the Hornets and is expected to miss at least two more games. Richard Jefferson started in Parsons' place, putting up 10 points, 10 rebounds, and four assists in 33 minutes. The Mavs welcomed Amar'e Stoudemire to the team, and he put up 14 points and three rebounds in just 11 minutes off the bench in his debut. Charlotte has dropped five straight games going back to Feb. 7, but they still sit just a half game out of the final playoff spot in the East. Kemba Walker should be out another three to four weeks recovering from knee surgery, but the team traded for Mo Williams last week, and Williams made his debut Saturday, stepping right into the starting lineup at point guard. To follow up his double - double of 24 points and 12 assists from Saturday, Williams put up 22 points and three assists Sunday. He played 38 minutes in each game, showing that the Hornets plan to use him as much as possible until Walker returns. The Mavericks will stay home to host the Raptors on Tuesday, and the Hornets will have off until Wednesday when they continue their road trip in Chicago.

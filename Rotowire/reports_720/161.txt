The Utah Jazz (26 - 36) defeated the Brooklyn Nets (25 - 36) 95 - 88 on Sunday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Jazz continued their strong play of late, recording their second straight win and seventh of their last ten. Despite the loss, the Nets actually were the superior shooters in this one, going 50 percent from the field and 53 percent from the three - point line, while the Jazz finished at 47 percent from the floor and 46 percent from deep. What may have been the deciding factor were free throws though. The Jazz converted on 17 - of - 21, while the Nets shot just 11 and converted on only four of those 11 attempts. As has been the case for the Jazz all season, both Gordon Hayward and Derrick Favors did the bulk of the work offensively. Hayward finished with a team - high of 24 points (7 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 8 - 9 FT), while adding five rebounds and three steals as well. It was his second impressive performance in a row, as he's combined for 49 points, 14 rebounds, five assists and four steals over his last two. He's now averaging 20 points and 5 rebounds on the year. Favors, on the other hand, posted 22 points (8 - 16 FG, 6 - 8 FT), eight rebounds and four assists in 37 minutes. He's also played very well of late, averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last four games. Rookie Dante Exum had one of the better games of his career, notching double figures in points for just the seventh time this season and first since the end of January. He went 5 - for - 6 from the field and a perfect 4 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 14 points, while adding four assists as well. The only other Jazz player to reach double - digit points was Trey Burke, who came off the bench for 12 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt) and four assists in 20 minutes. The Nets really struggled to score in this one, with just three players reaching double figures in points. One of those players was Brook Lopez, who took over the starting center spot for Mason Plumlee, as Plumlee was put back into a bench role. In 35 minutes, Lopez scored 19 points (8 - 17 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 5 FT), to go along with 10 rebounds and two blocked shots. It was his second double - double in a row, as he's combined for 38 points and 23 rebounds over that span. He's now averaging 16 points and 7 rebounds on the season. Along with Lopez, Thaddeus Young also moved into the starting lineup Sunday, pushing Alan Anderson to the bench. He matched a team - high with 19 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), while also adding three rebounds and four steals in 32 minutes. With such a strong performance, he should continue to start for the forseeable future. Coming off the bench, Bojan Bogdanovic added 11 points (4 - 7 FG, 3 - 4 3Pt) in 21 minutes. Both Joe Johnson and Deron Williams struggled in this one, scoring nine and six points respectively. The Jazz's next game will be at home against the New York Knicks on Tuesday, while the Nets will be at home against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday.

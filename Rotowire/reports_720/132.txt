The Miami Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers, 95 - 89, at American Airlines Arena on Wednesday. While these are teams that have n't quite lived up to expectations this season, they left it all on the floor here. Miami turned on the defense in the fourth quarter, as they held the Pacers to just 10 points en route to a comeback win. Indiana struggled all night from the field though, as they hit just 37 percent of their shots. Rebounding was huge for the Heat, as they won that battle, 58 - 38. In addition, Miami recorded 23 assists, while holding the Pacers to just 14. There were nine ties and 14 lead changes, as neither team led by more than seven points. Indiana (13 - 13) has been a bit of a disappointment this season and losses like this only add to the skepticism. Paul George struggled from the field, as he accumulated 22 points, seven rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 22 shooting. C.J. Miles was second on the team, as he dropped 15 points off the bench. Myles Turner had a nice all - around game, amassing 11 points, seven rebounds, two assists and five blocks in the defeat. The Pacers will look to play better on Friday in a road matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans. Miami (9 - 17) has not had the results they want this year, but they continue to play well and wins like this only confirm that point. Hassan Whiteside was the player of the game, as he totaled 26 points and 22 rebounds on 10 - of - 16 shooting. Goran Dragic was the only other starter in double figures, as he tallied 11 points, five rebounds and six assists. The bench was huge, as Josh Richardson, Tyler Johnson and James Johnson all scored in double figures. Tyler Johnson finished with 15 points, five rebounds, three assists and four blocks, while James Johnson accrued 14 points, three rebounds and six assists. On deck for the Heat is a home matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.

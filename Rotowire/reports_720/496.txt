The Portland Trail Blazers (51 - 27) defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves (16 - 62) 116 - 91 on Wednesday at the Moda Center in Portland. In securing the victory, the Trail Blazers moved to just two games back from the Memphis Grizzlies and Houston Rockets, who are tied for the second overall spot in the Western Conference standings. With just four games left in the regular season, they still have a shot at making their case for that second or third projected playoff seed. The Blazers were the much better shooting team in this one, going 49 percent from the field and 36 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at 38 percent from the floor and just 27 percent from deep. LaMarcus Aldridge had his way with the young frontcourt of the Timberwolves. He went 10 - for - 16 from the field to score a team - high of 24 points, while also adding 13 rebounds over 29 minutes. It marked his second straight double - double, a stretch where he's combined for 45 points and 25 rebounds. Fellow superstar Damian Lillard also played a factor in the victory. He did n't shoot the best, but he still finished with 17 points (4 - 13 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and six assists. He was coming off a 36 - point showing on Monday, so it was somewhat of a let down performance. Like Aldridge, Robin Lopez also had success against the Timberwolves frontcourt. He went 7 - for - 8 from the field and 4 - for - 4 from the free throw line to score 18 points, while adding six rebounds as well. Coming off the bench, CJ McCollum chipped in with 13 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt) over 25 minutes. With a ton of injuries causing a depleted roster for the Timberwolves, it turned into the Andrew Wiggins show, as he finished with a game - high of 29 points (9 - 22 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 11 - 15 FT), to go along with five rebounds and four assists. It marked his fourth straight game surpassing the 20 - point mark, a stretch where he's averaging 25 points per game.He continues to show why he was selected with the first overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. Fellow rookie Zach LaVine also continues to show his worth. LaVine posted 18 points (6 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT), six assists and two steals, while playing 38 minutes. He had posted his second career double - double on Tuesday, so this marked another nice contribution for the young guard. Kevin Martin also added 17 points (5 - 15 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and three rebounds. Coming off the bench, Chase Budinger was the final Timberwolves player to reach double figures, as he finished with 12 points and five steals. The Trail Blazers' next game will be on the road against the Golden State Warriors on Thursday, while the Timberwolves will travel to Los Angeles to play the Lakers on Friday.

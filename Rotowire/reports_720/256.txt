The Pelicans improved to 16 - 15 on the season Tuesday night by knocking off the Suns by a score of 110 - 106. Anthony Davis was dominant yet again as he nearly posted a 20 - 20 performance. He ended up with 19 points on 7 - of - 15 shooting and added 18 rebounds to cement his fourth double - double in five games. The Suns (18 - 15) had their six - game winning streak snapped. They shot well from the floor with a 48 percent mark, but were out - rebounded by a count of 49 - 38. Phoenix has one more chance to end 2014 on a high note as they take on the Thunder in Oklahoma City on New Year's Eve. The Pelicans benefited from Davis' big night, but Tyreke Evans was key down the stretch for New Orleans. Evans had ten points in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory for the Pelicans. New Orleans also has a quick turnaround as they travel to San Antonio to take on the Spurs on Wednesday night.

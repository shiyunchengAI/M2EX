The Golden State Warriors (51 - 12) defeated the Detroit Pistons (23 - 40) 105 - 98 on Wednesday in Oakland. The Warriors were able to open up their lead in the fourth quarter behind Klay Thompson, who finished with 27 points on 11 - of - 19 shooting. Thompson's running mate in the backcourt, MVP-candidate Stephen Curry, struggled shooting the ball in the victory and finished with just nine points on 11 - of - 10 shooting, but was still able to dish out 11 assists. Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut combined for a solid effort in the frontcourt, putting together 25 points and 13 rebounds between the two of them. Andre Iguodala (13), Marreese Speights (12), and Leandro Barbosa (10) all scored in double figures off the bench for Golden State. The win brings the Warriors' lead as the one - seed in the Western Conference to a commanding 7 games. Andre Drummond was a force in the paint for the Pistons in the losing effort, scoring 22 points on 11 - of - 25 shooting and grabbing 27 rebounds, 17 of them offensive, in 34 minutes. Greg Monroe also had a solid outing, recording 20 points on 7 - of - 18 shooting and nine rebounds in 32 minutes. After having just two points and three assists in his last outing, Reggie Jackson bounced back to put up 14 points on 7 - of - 15 shooting and nine assists. Caron Butler replaced Tayshaun Prince in the starting lineup, but only scored four points in 20 minutes. The loss further hurts Detroit's already slim playoff chances, as they currently sit six games behind the eighth - place Miami Heat. Up next, the Warriors will head to Denver Friday to take on the Nuggets, while the Pistons will travel to Portland Friday to go up against the TrailBlazers.

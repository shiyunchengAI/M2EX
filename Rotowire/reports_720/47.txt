The Phoenix Suns dropped their third straight as they fell 109 - 94 to the visiting Indiana Pacers on Wednesday evening at Talking Stick Resort Arena. Despite facing the second night of a back - to - back, the Suns started out strong and led 53 - 49 at the beginning of the second half, but the Pacers went on to win the final two quarters, including a 27 - 14 fourth quarter. The Pacers (11 - 11) did well to grind out the win as they faced the fourth game of their current five - game road trip. Despite coming off a monumental 142 - 106 loss in Golden State on Monday, Indiana bounced back to earn their third road win of the season. Paul George was the high - point man for Indiana, with 25 points on 8 - of - 18 shooting and 8 - of - 10 from the foul line. George also added 13 rebounds and three steals to round out his stat line. Myles Turner gave the Pacers a boost early and finished the game with 20 points, while going 7 - of - 11 from the field. Jeff Teague went 1 - of - 4 from long range but finished with 19 points and 11 assists. The Pacers will look to make it two straight wins as they take on the struggling Mavericks in Dallas on Friday. The Suns (6 - 16) came out with a competitive first half but were out - scored 60 - 41 in the second half. They drop to 3 - 6 at home with this loss, which also marks their seventh loss in their last ten games. Despite being back at full strength after a few injuries early in the season, the Suns have yet to pull it together. They had six players score in double digits but no one with more than 15 points as they fell short at home on a night when they needed to take advantage of a travel - worn opponent. The Suns will look to bounce back as they take on the Lakers in Los Angeles on Friday.

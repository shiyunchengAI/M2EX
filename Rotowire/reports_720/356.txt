The Sacramento Kings (24 - 25) routed the visiting Washington Wizards (40 - 30) ,109 - 86 on Sunday at the Sleep Train Arena. Sacramento simply outplayed Washington for much of the game and really started to pull away in the third. A seven point lead at halftime for the Kings suddenly ballooned to 20 by the end of the third quarter. Bradley Beal was the only Wizard in double figures until midway through the third and finished with a team - high 19 points. Sacramento built a large lead over Washington when they met last Saturday, but was intent on not letting the lead slip away this time as they evened the season series at one game apiece. Washington's four - game road trip got off to a promising start Wednesday with a hard fought victory over Utah, but has since sputtered out with two straight losses. John Wall had a poor outing by his standards, going 3 - for - 10 from the field to end up with nine points in 33 minutes of action. Kris Humphries missed Sunday's game and has not played since late February. Washington has an opportunity to salvage this road trip with a big game Monday against Golden State. Sacramento got its second straight win on Sunday with a terrific shooting performance. The Kings shot 51% from the field and 47 percent from beyond the arc. DeMarcus Cousins returned to action Sunday after missing two games with a calf injury. The star big man finished with 20 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in just 23 minutes on the floor. Ben McLemore had a strong outing, scoring all 17 of his points in the second half. The Kings will return to action Tuesday when they host the 76ers.

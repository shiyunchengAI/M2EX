The Golden State Warriors (180) would not have their record tarnished by the lowly Sacramento Kings (6 - 12) as they came up with the 120 - 101 win on Saturday night, in Oakland. The Kings started out well as they put up a competitive first quarter but could not keep up with the high - paced, high - efficiency Warriors. Sacramento was missing DeMarcus Cousins again, who is still out with a sore back. Rudy Gay led the way for the Kings with 20 points scored on 7 - 20 shooting, he also pulled down seven boards, in a limited 27 minutes. Kosta Koufos started in place of Cousins and put up a decent 14 points on 7 - 13 shooting, along with seven rebounds. Omri Casspi chipped in 11 points and seven rebounds in 28 minutes. The Kings as a team shot only 39 percent from the field. Golden State fielded a balanced offense and played as a cohesive unit with an amazing 32 assists on 39 made field goals. This was far from a one man show as six players scored in double digits and no one scored more than 19. Stephen Curry finished with 19 points, six assists and four rebounds in 29 minutes. Curry took only seven field goal attempts, six of them from deep. He shot 4 - 7 from the field, 3 - 6 from deep. Draymond Green posted a beautiful triple double with 13 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in 35 minutes. Green also had four blocked shots. Festus Ezeli put up a double double consisting of 11 points and 11 rebounds in only 17 minutes off the bench. Next up Golden State will be visiting Utah for a match on Monday, where perhaps the altitude will throw the Warriors off their game. Sacramento will be hosting Dallas on Monday.

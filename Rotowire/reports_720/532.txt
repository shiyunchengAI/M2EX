The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Detroit Pistons 114 - 82 at Staples Center on Monday. The Clippers (6 - 1) continued what has been a dominant start to the regular season, earning what was not only their sixth win of the season, but their sixth win by double - digit points. Along with that, Chris Paul continues to be very effective as the team's floor leader, notching 24 points, eight assists and six rebounds despite not playing a single minute in the fourth quarter, as the Clippers dominated the Pistons from start to finish. Paul is now averaging 19 points, 9 assists and 6 rebounds despite only playing 30 minutes per game to start the year. Additionally, after getting off to a rough start of the season, J.J. Redick notched his first 20 - point game of the season, as he hit 3 - of - 4 shots from behind the arc and 6 - of - 9 from the field overall. As a team, the Clippers shot a scorching 52 percent from long range. For the Pistons (4 - 3), there was n't much to be excited about, as Andre Drummond was their leading scorer on the night with just 15 points on top of 12 rebounds. In fact, given how poorly the team played, Detroit's reserves ended up outscoring their starts 42 - 40 with Jon Leuer leading the way for the bench mob by recording 14 points and six rebounds in 29 minutes. The Pistons, after winning three of their first four regular season games, have now dropped two of their last three while their offensive continues to be hot and cold. Up next, Detroit will travel to Phoenix on Wednesday to take on the Suns, while the Clippers will stay at home to play the Trail Blazers on Wednesday.

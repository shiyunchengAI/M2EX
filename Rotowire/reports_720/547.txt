The Atlanta Hawks (45 - 12) beat the Dallas Mavericks (39 - 21) 104 - 87 on Wednesday. Dennis Schroder had a nice game off the bench, leading the Hawks with 17 points. All five starters also scored in double figures for the Hawks. Jeff Teague has been battling an illness, but he was able to start against Dallas and finished with 11 points in 26 minutes. There was a brief delay during the first quarter, as the roof at Phillips Arena was leaking water onto the court. The issue was resolved and the game continued, as Atlanta battled back from an 11 - point deficit after the delay. The Mavericks were without point guard Rajon Rondo after he was given a one - game suspension for a verbal altercation with coach Rick Carlisle during Tuesday's contest. The spat apparently continued in the locker room, and Rondo was forced to sit out Wednesday for conduct detrimental to the team. J.J. Barea was given the nod to start the game in place of Rondo, finishing with 13 points, seven assists and five rebounds in 30 minutes. Monta Ellis led Dallas in scoring with 19 points, but Dirk Nowitzk had his worst scoring outing of the season, recording just four points in 25 minutes of action. Dallas will host the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, and the Hawks will host the Orlando Magic on Friday.

The Sacramento Kings (23 - 45), the league’s worst defense since the All-Star break, defeated the Charlotte Hornets (29 - 38), 101 - 91. DeMarcus Cousins warmed up prior to the game, but ultimately decided not to play for the second straight game with an ailing calf. Rudy Gay nearly accounted for a third of the team’s points, scoring 33 to go with nine rebounds, four assists, two steals and two three - pointers in 37 minutes. Omri Casspi replaced Ryan Hollins in the starting lineup, compiling 10 points, five rebounds, two assists and one three - pointer in 33 minutes. Reggie Evans grabbed 16 rebounds in 21 minutes, helping the Kings end a four - game losing streak. Derrick Williams threw down a monster dunk on Bismack Biyombo, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes off the bench. The Hornets fell half a game behind the Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers for the final spot in the Eastern Conference playoff push, losing their third straight game. Kemba Walker was inserted into the starting lineup after coming off the bench the previous four games. Walker and the man he replaced, Mo Williams, were each assessed a technical foul. Even worse, Williams missed his first 11 shots and finished 3 - of - 15 from the field for nine points. Walker scored 18 points and accumulated four steals in 31 minutes. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist blocked a shot for the seventh straight game. The Kings play their fourth straight home game when they face the Washington Wizards on Sunday. The Hornets begin a stretch of five games in seven nights Sunday when they take on the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Mike Conley needed only 33 minutes to turn in his best outing of the season, as the point guard tore up the Suns for 38 points, nine assists and six rebounds. Conley also added seven three - pointers, and finished a remarkable 12 - of - 18 from the field. Marc Gasol has cooled off considerably from his three straight 30 - plus point games, but was still efficient in his 18 points after going 6 - of - 12 from the field. The Suns had no answer for the Grizzlies 16 - of - 28 shooting from behind the three - point line. Marquese Chriss did have a solid outing in his starting role, as he finished with 20 points on 8 - of - 12 shooting, to go with six rebounds, two steals and one block. Devin Booker could not find a rhythm and scored 22 points on 20 shots, alongside two assists and six boards.

The host Sacramento Kings defeated the visiting New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, 102 - 94. Neither team was able to convincingly pull away, with Sacramento (4 - 5) holding a single - digit lead heading into the final minute of the game. This has been somewhat of a theme for New Orleans (0 - 8), who has played many teams closely this season but has yet to record a win. For Sacramento, the key seemed to be feeding All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins, who led the squad with 28 points despite an off night on the glass. High-scoring wing Rudy Gay also turned in a solid performance, posting 21 points, six assists, and six rebounds. Overall, Sacramento was able to out - shoot their opponents from deep, hitting eight three - pointers on the night. For the Pelicans, Tuesday was yet another disappointing result in what has been a string of losses to start the season. In sticking with the trend, it was also a big night for star forward Anthony Davis, who led the team and the game with 34 points. Davis also made his presence felt on defense with two steals and four blocks. Only two other Pelicans cracked double - digits, however, with three of the starting five combining for just 15 points on the night. The Pelicans will visit Milwaukee on Thursday, while the Kings will host the Lakers.

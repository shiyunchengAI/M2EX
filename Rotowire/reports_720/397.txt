The Cleveland Cavaliers (3 - 3) took down the New Orleans Pelicans (3 - 3) 118 - 111 on Monday night at the Quicken Loans Arena. All of the sudden, the Cavaliers find themselves back at the .500 mark after a slow start to the season. This win for LeBron James and company came over Anthony Davis and the up - and - coming New Orleans Pelicans. The Cavaliers were led by none other than James, who had an impressive triple - double, with 32 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 13 - 17 FT), 12 rebounds and 10 assists in 40 minutes. Kyrie Irving had an impressive game as well, putting up 32 points (11 - 21 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT), with nine assists and five rebounds in 41 minutes. The Cavaliers will get a few days off before heading to Boston to take on the Celtics on Friday night. The Pelicans received a big boost off of the bench from Ryan Anderson on Monday night, as he scored 32 points (11 - 19 FG, 8 - 12 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), with five rebounds, three assists and one steal in 34 minutes off the bench. We ca n't overlook the strong play of Anthony Davis once again either, as he had 27 points (12 - 21 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT), with 14 rebounds, four assists, four steals and three blocks in 40 minutes. The Pelicans are heading back home next, and they'll be taking on Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night.

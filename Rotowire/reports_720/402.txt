It's been an up - and - down last few games for Harrison Barnes, with Tuesday's performance against his former team, the Golden State Warriors, being one of the downs. Barnes shot just 2 - of - 10 from the field en route to scoring just five points in 34 minutes in the 25 - point loss. But that was n't even Barnes' worst performance of the season. In fact, his worst performance came just two games prior in a 116 - 74 beatdown from the 76ers, where the swingman shot 2 - of - 7 from the field and scored a season - low four points in 24 minutes. The Mavericks are now 2 - 2 in their last four games, with Barnes combining for nine points on 4 - of - 17 shooting in the losses and combining for 41 points on a wildly impressive 18 - of - 31 (58 percent) shooting from the field in the victories, showing that Dallas, at this point in the season, are going wherever Barnes takes them.

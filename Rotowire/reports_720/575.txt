The Atlanta Hawks (2 - 19) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (15 - 6) 95 - 79 on Wednesday. Atlanta has won eight straight games and sit at second place in the Eastern Conference standings. They've been healthy most of the season, giving them a great deal of consistency in their rotation from night to night. Both teams shot just 42 percent from the field Wednesday, but the Hawks earned several extra possessions by collecting 16 offensive rebounds and beating the Sixers in total rebounds 52 - 39. The Hawks will host the Orlando Magic on Friday. Philadelphia has won two of their last four games, showing greater cohesion on the court since Tony Wroten went down with a knee injury six games ago, opening the door to allow Michael Carter-Williams to operate as the lone primary ball - handler. Alexey Shved returned to the lineup after missing three games with a hip injury. He played 16 minutes off the bench and finished with 13 points. Wroten is targeting a return to the court Friday when the Sixers take on the Nets in Brooklyn. During the game, it was reported by members of the media that the Sixers and Brooklyn Nets agreed to a trade that would include sending Brandon Davies to the Nets in exchange for Andrei Kirilenko and other minor pieces. The deal is not expected to be finalized until sometime Thursday.

The Dallas Mavericks (11 - 5) defeated the New York Knicks (4 - 12) 109 - 102 in overtime on Wednesday. Dallas was coming off of back - to - back losses heading into Wednesday's game, and a matchup against the Knicks was just what the doctor ordered. Tyson Chandler wowed the crowd with a 25 - rebound performance, and he even chipped in on offense, putting up 17 points in his 43 minutes. Dirk Nowitzki scored a game - high 30 points. The Mavericks will begin a four - game road trip in Toronto on Friday against the Raptors. New York has dropped two straight games, but they put up a fight Wednesday even with Carmelo Anthony (back spasms) out of action. J.R. Smith stepped into the starting lineup in Anthony's place. He finished with 15 points and five assists in 36 minutes. Jose Calderon, in just his third game back from a calf injury, put up 21 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. The Knicks will finish their three - game road trip against the Thunder in Oklahoma City on Friday. Anthony is not expected to play in that game, either.

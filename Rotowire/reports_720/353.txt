There was n't a whole lot to separate these two teams, as there were 19 lead changes and 14 ties in this Eastern Conference battle. No team led by more than eight points either, with neither team letting up at any point. Many of the statistics were very even, as they were nearly tied in rebounds, assists, turnovers and points in the paint. Despite Jimmy Butler, Robin Lopez, Rajon Rondo, Doug McDermott and Dwyane Wade all shooting below 50 percent, they all scored at least 13 points in the win. The 16 points and 12 rebounds for Rondo marked his second double - double in a Chicago uniform. Strangely enough, he's yet to reach double - digit assists in any game this season, after leading the league in that category last year. Hassan Whiteside's 20 points and 20 rebounds looks even more impressive when you consider the Bulls are the second - best rebounding team in the NBA.

The San Antonio Spurs (5 - 2) defeated the Sacramento Kings (1 - 7) 104 - 83 Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.

Tim Duncan added a double - double of 11 points and 14 rebounds in just 23 minutes. LaMarcus Aldridge fell just short of a double - double, recording 16 points and nine rebounds in 26 minutes. For the Kings, Cousins returned in a big way, recording 21 points and 12 rebounds in 32 minutes, but shot just 5 - of - 20 from the field.

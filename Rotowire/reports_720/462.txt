He went 5 - for - 9 from the field and 1 - for - 1 from the three - point line to score 12 points in 29 minutes. Marcin Gortat reached double figures as well with 11 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 1 FT) and seven rebounds of his own.

He recorded a season - high of 18 points (8 - 18 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT), to go along with three rebounds and three assists.

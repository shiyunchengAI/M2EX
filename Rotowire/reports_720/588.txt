The visiting Miami Heat defeated the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday, 106 - 98. It was a back and forth game, with Miami (6 - 12) earning the win on strong fourth - quarter play. The Heat outscored Denver 31 - 18 in the fourth, ending the game comfortably in the lead. The Heat's Hassan Whiteside led the team in both scoring and rebounding, posting 25 and 16 respectively. Whiteside also blocked four shots. The big man's effort kept Miami competitive with the Nuggets on the glass, despite Denver's status as the top rebounding team in the league. Miami saw a huge advantage in turnovers, coughing up the ball only six times while forcing 19 turnovers for Denver. Strong defensive play contributed to the differential, as Miami stole the ball 14 times in total. Denver (7 - 11) was held to just 41 percent shooting on the night, crumbling under the pressure of the tough Miami defense. Starter Emmanuel Mudiay shot just 3 - of - 11 from the field, while forward Danilo Gallinari went just 6 - of - 16. Gallinari was one of four Nuggets to tie for the team lead in scoring with 17 points. Another one of those four, sophomore Nikola Jokic, had 17 points and 14 rebounds off the bench. Jokic helped counter the poor shooting of his teammates by going 7 - of - 11 from the floor. The Heat will visit Utah on Thursday while the Nuggets will host the Rockets on Friday.

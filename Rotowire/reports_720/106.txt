The Atlanta Hawks defeated the visiting Boston Celtics, 89 - 72, to take a 20 series lead in the Eastern Conference first - round playoffs Tuesday at Philips Arena. The Celtics were out of it early, as they scored just seven points in the first quarter, the fewest in an opening quarter in the playoffs since the NBA adopted the shot clock in 1954. It was also a franchise low for any quarter in the playoffs. Boston missed 20 of 23 shots in the first quarter, including six 3 - point attempts, and had six shots blocked. Despite an abysmal 1 - for - 12 shooting night from star forward Paul Millsap, the Hawks easily outscored the Celtics. This was due in large part to five big 3 - pointers from sharpshooting veteran Kyle Korver, who finished with 17 points. Also recording 17 was All-Star big man Al Horford, who blocked five shots. Things have gotten off to a rocky start for the Celtics in the series. Guard Avery Bradley will likely miss the remainder of the series with a right hamstring injury, while guard Marcus Smart and big man Kelly Olynyk have more minor injuries. Overall, though, Bradley (the team's second - leading regular season scorer) was missed on Tuesday, as the team finished 28 of 88 from the floor (32 percent). Smart and forward Jae Crowder combined for a dismal 2 of 20. Boston will look to turn things around at home in Game 3 on Friday.

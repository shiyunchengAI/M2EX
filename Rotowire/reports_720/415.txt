The Charlotte Hornets (7 - 6) handled the Philadelphia 76ers (0 - 13) 113 - 88 on Friday. These were two teams going in opposite directions coming into Friday's game and that fact ended up playing out on the court yet again. It was a 21 - point game at the half and the Sixers couldn’t really recover after that poor start. The biggest discrepancies in the game were the free - throw shooting and turnovers. Charlotte made 21 - of - 22 free - throws while the Sixers went just 16 - for - 22 and the Hornets won the turnover battle 17 - 11. It was already ugly for the Sixers, but it's getting down right atrocious at this point. What's really hurting this team is their offense, as they rank dead - last in the NBA in scoring and lowered that average here. Philadelphia opted to go with a smaller lineup by bringing Nerlens Noel off the bench, which is a strange move considering he's arguably their best player. He still played 27 minutes and tallied 16 points and nine rebounds in the loss. The best player for the Sixers on this night was Nik Stauskas, who totaled 15 points, three assists and two rebounds in the defeat. Philadelphia will look to grab that first elusive win in Miami on Saturday against the Heat. The Hornets are quietly one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now, as they have won seven of their last 10 games. Much of that success can be credited to Nicolas Batum, but it was the mainstay combo of Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson who got it done on Friday night. Walker tallied 20 points and seven assists while Jefferson collected 26 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks in the win. Rookie Frank Kaminsky also had his best game in his short career, contributing nine points, three rebounds and three assists in the victory. This is a dangerous team in the East going forward and they look like a threat to make the playoffs and possibly win a game in the postseason for the first time in 14 years. They'll look to keep up this form against the Sacramento Kings on Monday.

The sliding Chicago Bulls (28 - 26) bounced back for a 116 - 106 win over the red - hot Toronto Raptors (35 - 18) on Friday night. Chicago, still without star guard Jimmy Butler (knee), has fallen in the Eastern Conference standings. Once rivaling Cleveland for top of the conference, Chicago started February 1 - 6 and remains at risk for losing a playoff spot. Friday's win certainly helps the Bulls' case, however, as they were able to upend the dominant Toronto Raptors. Sophomore Doug McDermott came up big for the Bulls, scoring a career - high 30 points on 13 - for - 17 shooting. "McBuckets" played big minutes due to the absence of Chicago's All-Star wing, and he did not crack under the pressure. The Creighton alumni did not turn over the ball in 31 minutes of play. Former MVP Derrick Rose continued his hot start to 2016, pouring in 26 points on solid 12 - for - 20 shooting. The Raptors came into the All-Star break as one of the NBA's hottest teams, but faltered in Chicago on Friday. While every starter reached double - digits, their bench combined for just nine points with no backup contributing more than two. The second unit went a combined 4 - for - 15 in what was a disastrous bench performance from the Raps. The starters, however, came up big for Toronto, with Kyle Lowry, Jonas Valanciunas, and DeMar DeRozan posting 27, 25, and 22 respectively. Valanciunas added 12 rebounds for one of his biggest nights of the season. Both teams will host Western Conference opponents on Sunday. Chicago will host the struggling Lakers, while the Raptors are scheduled to take on the Memphis Grizzlies.

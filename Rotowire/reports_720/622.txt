Tristan Thompson was the unsung hero for the Cavaliers, producing 15 points, a team - high 12 rebounds, one assist, and one steal in 29 minutes off the bench. Kyrie Irving and J.R. Smith combined to shoot 6 - of - 23 from the field. Irving picked up two fouls early in the first quarter and didn’t return until the third quarter. P.J.Tucker joined the starting lineup after a one - game demotion for missing the team bus to shootaround, shifting Marcus Morris back to a reserve role. T.J. Warren was the only Suns player to convert more than half his shots. The starting lineup shot a combined 16 - of - 52, and Markieff Morris scored a team - high 16 points. Brandan Wright played a season - high 30 minutes and provided seven points, seven rebounds, one assist, two steals and three blocks.

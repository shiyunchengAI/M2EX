The Chicago Bulls (42 - 40) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (10 - 72) in the season finale Wednesday night at United Center, 115 - 105. Philadelphia exploded out of the gate, scoring 32 points in the first quarter and 60 poitns in the first half, enough to take a nine - point lead into the break. But the 76ers offense completely collapsed in the third quarter, as Philadelphia notched just 13 points in the frame and saw their nine - point lead turn into a 13 - point deficit, a big enough swing for the Bulls to coast to the finish line. The three - pointers were flying all day in this one, as the two teams combined to make 32 of their 59 attempts, a ridiculous 54 shooting percentage from downtown for the two squads. Nikola Mirotic knocked down seven three - pointers en route to a 32 - point night to lead all scorers. Jrue Holiday hit five threes of his own and finished with 29 points, and Jimmy Butler notched a triple - double with 10 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists. Chicago shot just 42 percent from inside the arc but made 15 of their 24 three - pionters (63 percent), a relentless barrage that inevitably sunk the 76ers. Robert Covington led the 76ers with six three - poinit makes and 27 points. Jerian Grant finished with 20 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 4 3PT, 4 - 6 FT) and Hollis Thompson came off the bench to add 21 points (8 - 13 FG, 3 - 6 3PT, 2 - 3 FT). The 76ers shot well from three - point land (17 - 35, 49 percent) but were destroyed on the glass, as they managed just four offensive rebounds and were outrebounded overall 53 - 31. Both clubs have been eliminated from postseason contention.

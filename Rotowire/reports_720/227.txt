The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 122 - 111, at American Airlines Center on Tuesday. All the talk around this game will be around Dirk Nowitzki and rightfully so. Nowitzki became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 30,0 points, as he did it with a patented Nowitzki fade away. That feat came in a relatively easy win too, as it was a wire - to - wire victory for Dallas, with them leading by double - digits for the final 35 minutes. The Mavericks actually took a 29 - point lead into the fourth quarter, but the Los Angeles starters used that garbage time to cut it to a respectable scoreline. Dallas was lights out from the field, as they shot 52 percent from the field and 55 percent from three - point range. The Mavericks also thrived off turnovers, winning the points off turnover differential, 29 - 14. The Lakers (19 - 45) have been one of the worst teams in the league over recent months and this loss was much worse than it looks in the box score. Julius Randle was a bright spot, as he accumulated 13 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists en route to a triple - double. D'Angelo Russell led the starters with 22 points, four assists and four steals. Jordan Clarkson led the bench, as he provided 22 points and two assists. The Lakers will return to action on Thursday in a road matchup against the Phoenix Suns. The Mavericks (27 - 36) now find themselves within two games of the eight - seed in the West and wins like this show just how hard they're fighting for that spot. Nowitzki not only reached the 30,0 - point threshold, he scored a game - high 25 points to go along with 11 rebounds. Seth Curry finished second on the team, collecting 18 points, two rebounds and five assists. Yogi Ferrell finished with 16 points and seven assists, while Harrison Barnes accrued 14 points and six rebounds. Nerlens Noel came off the bench to amass 11 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks. Dallas will look to keep rolling on Friday against the Brooklyn Nets.

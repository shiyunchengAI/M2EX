The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Toronto Raptors 108 - 106 Tuesday at AirCanada Centre. The Spurs (36 - 9) came into Tuesday's matchup without Pau Gasol (finger), Kawhi Leonard (hand) and Tony Parker (foot), but it did n't matter. Even without three regular starters, San Antonio was able to hold off a struggling Raptors (28 - 17) team, who remains without their All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan (ankle). In the absence of three stars, LaMarcus Aldridge stepped up with a solid performance, recording a team - high 21 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting from the field to go along with seven rebounds. Patty Mills then added 18 points in 30 critical minutes off the bench. Overall, it was n't the prettiest performance from San Antonio, as they shot just 45 percent from the field and 29 percent from behind the arc, but they still managed to notch their fifth straight victory. As for the Raptors, they continue to struggle, as they have now lost four games in a row after winning four in a row just before that. They had a prime opportunity to end that streak against a banged up San Antonio team, but while Kyle Lowry and the Toronto backcourt managed to take advantage, the frontcourt players struggled to do so. Lowry finished with a game - high 30 points and five rebounds, while Terrance Ross and Norman Powell added 21 and 16 points, respectively. The team's start frontcourt, however, made up of Jonas Valanciunas, Jared Sullinger and DeMarre Carroll combined to score a grand total of just 11 points. Ball disruption was the ultimate problem, however, as the team managed just 10 assists to their 10 turnovers. Up next, the Spurs will try to make it six straight wins Friday in New Orleans, while the the Raptors will look to end their losing streak when they take on the Grizzlies on Wednesday.

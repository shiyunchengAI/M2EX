The Golden State Warriors (30) defeated the Houston Rockets (0 - 3) 115 - 80, in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals. Shooting mastermind, Stephen Curry dropped a legendary performance on the Rockets with 40 points in 35 minutes. He hit seven of his nine attempts from beyond the arc and also filled up the stat sheet with seven assists, five rebounds, two steals and one block. It certainly did n't hurt that Andrew Bogut stepped up his game against Dwight Howard, who has been somewhat hobbled by a knee injury. Bogut had 12 points, 12 rebounds and a block in 20 minutes of action, before fouling out. Golden State put it on the Rockets early and often. They led by 25 at halftime and Houston was unable to mount any sort of comeback. Draymond Green was a force to be reckoned with and Houston had no answer for him and Curry. Green had 17 points of his own to go along with a team - high 13 rebounds. The Rockets laid a dud at home in Game 3 and have now put themselves in a situation where they would need to win four straight games to advance to the NBA Finals. A feat that no team has ever accomplished after losing the first three games of the series. James Harden could n't find the magic that helped him finish second in the regular - season MVP award voting. He did a great job getting to the line as he usually does, going 10 - for - 11 from the charity stripe. However, he went just 3 - for - 16 from the field and could n't find his mojo. If the Rockets want to be the 2004 Red Sox of the NBA, they will need immaculate performances from their key players for four straight games. Golden State has n't lost three - straight games all season long, let alone four. Houston will host the Warriors in Game 4 on Monday.

The Utah Jazz (29 - 36) won their fifth straight game while extending the Detroit Pistons’ (23 - 43) losing streak to 10 consecutive games, effectively diminishing their playoff hopes in the 88 - 85 win. Andre Drummond was disqualified from the second half with a concussion, per league protocols. The two teams combined for 25 points in the third quarter. Derrick Favors took advantage of Andre Drummond’s absence, scoring 26 points in 35 minutes and attempting a career - high 13 free throws. Rudy Gobert grabbed 19 rebounds and blocked two shots in 39 minutes, padding his stats in a last ditch effort to garner Defensive Player of the Year votes. The Jazz has now won 12 of their past 15 games, overlapping with the trade of Enes Kanter to Oklahoma City. They’re seven games back of the final playoff spot with 17 games remaining, drawing an outside shot of postseason basketball if everything falls their way. Shawne Williams was suspended after squaring off in a head - butting competition with the Trail Blazers’ Joel Freeland in Friday’s loss. Tayshaun Prince was forced from the game with a sore hip, but he returned briefly in the waning moments to inbound the ball. Reggie Jackson was benched down the stretch, turning the ball over five times and making 4 - of - 11 shots. The Pistons’ bench accounted for 52 points in the loss. The Jazz host the Charlotte Hornets on Monday, and the Pistons get two days off before playing the Memphis Grizzlies at home.

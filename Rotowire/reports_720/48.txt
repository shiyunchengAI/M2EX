The Warriors got off to a strong start in defense of their title Tuesday night, claiming a resounding 111 - 95 victory over the Pelicans. New Orleans was already in a tough spot before the game even started, as six players (Omer Asik, Tyreke Evans, Jrue Holliday, Luke Babbitt, Quincy Pondexter, and Norris Cole) were ruled out, leaving just nine players available. To make matters worse, the Pelicans would later lose Dante Cunningham to a possible concussion. The pressure of keeping the Pelicans afloat fell squarely on Anthony Davis, who shot a woeful 4 - for - 20 from the field to finish with 18 points in what amounted to one of the worst games of his young career. A 17 - point, 10 - assist outburst off the bench by the recently signed Ish Smith enabled the Pelicans to stay within shouting distance by halftime, but the Warriors extended their lead to 19 by the end of the third quarter to put the came out of reach. Leading the Golden State attack was league MVP Stephen Curry, who came out guns blazing in the first 12 minutes. He set a personal - best mark in first quarter scoring with 24 points, and didn’t cool off much from there, ending the night with 40 points and seven assists on 14 - for - 24 shooting. Curry’s electrifying performance made up for quiet offensive nights from fellow starters Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, and Draymond Green, but the trio certainly made their presence felt. Green in particular was a notable performer, as he was responsible for shadowing Davis most of the night. The Pelicans will look to right the ship when they head north to Portland on Wednesday for the second game of a back - to - back, while the Warriors will enjoy two days off before they meet up with the Rockets in Houston in a rematch of last year’s Western Conference Finals.

The Sacramento Kings defeated the Denver Nuggets, 120 - 113, at Pepsi Center on Tuesday. In a battle between two teams battling for the eight - seed in the west, the Kings were able to prevail with a big road win. An 18 - 2 run in the second quarter was the decisive stretch for Sacramento, as they never relinquished their lead after that big run. Turnovers really killed Denver, as they committed 14 of them, while forcing just eight from the Kings. Sacramento shot 52 percent from the field, with Denver shooting 48 percent on their end. Sacramento (15 - 19) have n't had many road wins to celebrate this season, but this won catapulted them into playoff positioning for the time being. DeMarcus Cousins was once again the catalyst for the Kings, as he accumulated 31 points, six rebounds and six assists. Darren Collison had one of his best games of the season, tallying 26 points and seven assists. Kosta Koufos was the only other starter in double figures, scoring 18 points on 8 - of - 9 shooting. Arron Afflalo punished his former team with 19 points on 8 - of - 10 shooting off the bench. The Kings will play again on Wednesday, when they host the injury - riddled Miami Heat. Denver (14 - 21) had to play this game in the second half of a back - to - back set and they clearly were hampered by that fact in this loss. Danilo Gallinari did all he could for the Nuggets, leading the team with 24 points, four rebounds and three assists on 8 - of - 12 from the field. Nikola Jokic continued his recent surge, collecting 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Jusuf Nurkic was a nice spark off the bench, accruing 16 points, six rebounds and four assists. Things do n't get any easier for Denver, as they play the San Antonio Spurs for their next game on Thursday.

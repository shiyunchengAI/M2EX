The Indiana Pacers (16 - 30) defeated the Orlando Magic (15 - 32) 106 - 99 on Sunday at the Amway Center in Orlando. After ending the third quarter down 82 - 75, the Pacers went off in the fourth quarter, out - scoring the Magic 31 - 17 to steal the seven - point victory on the road. The Pacers were the superior shooters in this game, going 52 percent from the field and 40 percent from the three - point line, while the Magic went 49 percent from the floor and just 35 percent from beyond the arc. The Pacers received contributions from all over the court Sunday with six players reaching double figures in points. David West led the way, recording 20 points (8 - 15 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), four rebounds and two steals. He had n't been playing his best basketball over the last three games, so it was good to see him turn things around. Roy Hibbert notched a double - double, finishing with 11 points and 13 rebounds in only 23 minutes. He has n't played more than 20 minutes in each of his last three games, so with a little bit more time on the court, Hibbert was able to increase his production. Rodney Stuckey had a strong showing as well with 15 points (6 - 10 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and six assists. He's now averaging 11 points and 3 assists per game on the season. The Pacers bench had an impressive performance, led by George Hill and Damjan Rudez. Hill had 17 points (7 - 15 FG, 1 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT) and six rebounds, while Rudez had 18 points (7 - 10 FG, 4 - 7 3Pt) and three rebounds. The 18 points were a career - high for Rudez. As has been the case for most of the season, Victor Oladipo and Nikola Vucevic did most of the damage for the Magic. Vucevic led all scorers, finishing with 27 points (11 - 17 FG, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds. He's been unstoppable lately, averaging 29 points and 14 rebounds over his last three games. Oladipo on the other hand recorded 18 points (8 - 17 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) of his own, to go along with three assists. He was about right on par with his season averages of 16 points and 4 assists per game. Tobias Harris continued to come off the bench, but still played 30 minutes, finishing with 11 points and seven rebounds. The only other Magic player to reach double figures in points was Elfrid Payton, who contributed 10 points and eight assists. The Pacers' next game will be at home against the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, while the Magic will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Monday.

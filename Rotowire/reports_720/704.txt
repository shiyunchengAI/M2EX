The visiting Houston Rockets defeated the Denver Nuggets on Friday, 128 - 110. Houston (13 - 7) seemingly had no problem on Friday despite playing a double - OT game in Oakland against the Warriors on Thursday night. The grueling schedule did not stop the Rockets from taking both halves of their back - to - back. Much of the team's success can be attributed to star guard James Harden, who followed a triple - double on Thursday with 20 points, six rebounds, and seven assists in Denver. Harden and the Rockets have provided the most three - heavy offense in the league this season, and hit 17 three - pointers on Thursday to show it. Houston's bench played a critical role in the win, with sixth man Eric Gordon scoring 18 points and sophomore Sam Dekker scoring 17. The Nuggets (7 - 12), meanwhile, have now won only one of their last five games. Denver remains the top rebounding team in the league, and held a 52 - 42 advantage against Houston on the boards. Unfortunately for the Nuggets, this has not translated to the win column. The team struggled to match its opponent on the perimeter on Thursday, hitting just nine three - pointers on 30 percent shooting while allowing its opponents to shoot 50 percent from the field and hit 17 threes. Forward Wilson Chandler was an exception, as he continued his strong scoring stretch with 24 points from the bench. The Nuggets will visit Utah on Saturday, while the Rockets will host the Celtics on Monday.

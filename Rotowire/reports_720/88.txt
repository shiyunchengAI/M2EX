The Detroit Pistons defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 106 - 90, at Palace of Auburn Hills on Monday. The form of these teams would indicate an easy Cleveland win, but once LeBron James was declared inactive, Detroit felt as it was their game to have. They took care of business too, as they pulled out a wire - to - wire win and won each individual quarter by at least three points. Defense was key for the Pistons, as they held the Cavaliers to 38 percent shooting, while forcing 21 turnovers to just 30 made baskets. Three-point shooting really carried Detroit as well, as they went 16 - of - 28 from long range in their win. The Cavaliers (23 - 7) are coming off a historic win against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday, but it led to LeBron James being rested here and a lackluster performance from the rest of the team. Kyrie Irving led Cleveland in scoring, as he accrued 18 points, five rebounds and eight assists. Kevin Love recorded a double - double, tallying 17 points and 14 rebounds, while committing five turnovers in the defeat. Iman Shumpert, Key Felder and Channing Frye all provided 11 points a piece off the bench. Cleveland will be back to full force on Thursday in their next game against the Boston Celtics. The Pistons (15 - 18) have been in a terrible slide recently and a win over the team like the Cavaliers may be what they need to get going. Tobias Harries was moved to the bench last week and he continues to thrive in that role, as he led the team with 21 points, six rebounds and four assists. Reggie Jackson had one of his best games of the season, as he accumulated 13 points, six rebounds and six assists. Andre Drummond controlled the paint for Detroit, as he totaled 11 points, 17 rebounds and four assists. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope went 7 - of - 11 from the field to collect 18 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Detroit's next game is on Wednesday against the Milwaukee Bucks.

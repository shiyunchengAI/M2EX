Houston welcomed Memphis to town on Thanksgiving Eve, and was unable to defend its home court. The Grizzlies ended up taking the win 102 - 93. While the score was relatively close, Memphis held the upper hand through the majority of the contest. The Rockets continued their early season struggles and fell to 5 - 10, while the Grizzlies improved to 9 - 7. After starting the season slowly, the Grizzlies have heated up and won six of their last seven games. Four of those games have been without Zach Randolph, who has been sidelined with a knee injury since Nov. 16. With their star power forward absent, Matt Barnes entered the lineup and provided efficient statistics. He helped out with 13 points (5 - 11 FG, 2 - 6 3PT, 1 - 1 FT) eight rebounds, three assists, and one steal in 31 minutes of action. Memphis hopes to get Randolph back as they carry their momentum into Friday's game versus Atlanta. It was an all - around team effort for Memphis, who had six players, including all five starters, score in double digits. Jeff green led the way with 20 points (4 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3PT, 10 - 10 FT) and seven rebounds. Courtney Lee added a spark off the bench scoring 17 points on 8 - 14 shooting from the field. The only player to touch the court and not score was veteran Vince Carter, who did help out with six rebounds, two assists, and three steals. Houston was able to win their first game following the firing of former head coach Kevin McHale last week, but have lost three games since. James Harden did his part to help the Rockets take off, but was unable to do enough. He did finish the night with an impressive 40 points (12 - 19 FG, 5 - 9 3PT, 11 - 11 FT), five rebounds, five assists, three steals, and one block in 41 minutes. Jason Terry and Dwight Howard also chipped in with double figures, scoring 13 and 12 points respectively. The Rockets will look to turn things around Friday when they take on the winless 76ers in Houston.

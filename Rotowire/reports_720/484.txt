Once again, the box score rightfully belonged to Russell Westbrook, as the Thunder point guard notched his 22nd triple - double of the season, to go along with his game winning jumper with :1 remaining in the fourth quarter. Westbrook totaled 38 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists on 11 - of - 29 shooting. Enes Kanter was effective off the bench and scored 14 points on nine shots, to go with five rebounds in 29 minutes. Victor Oladipo was the only other Thunder scorer in double figures, as he scored 18 points to aid Westbrook in the victory. The Jazz were led by Gordon Hayward's 17 points, three of which were used to tie the game with :10 remaining in the final period. Utah struggled to find a scoring rhythm, as four players scored in double figures, but the team shot 43 percent from the field as a unit.

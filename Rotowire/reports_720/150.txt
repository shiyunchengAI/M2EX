The Sixers big men also struggled with the Blazers' bigs, as they were out - rebounded by a hefty 52 - 29 margin.

The Sixers were led by Michael Carter-Williams, who scored a season - high 24 points, while also grabbing seven rebounds. It was his seventh game of the season after sitting out with injury, and he seems to be getting back in a rhythm. Fellow backcourt mate Tony Wroten also had a solid all - around game on Monday. He came one assist shy of his second double - double of the season and finished with 20 points and nine assists. The third Sixer who reached the 20 - point mark was starting center Henry Sims.

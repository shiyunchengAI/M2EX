The Nets (28 - 39) defeated the Bucks (34 - 35) 129 - 127 on Friday. The game was a thriller and needed three overtimes to claim a victor. With a minute and 19 seconds left in regulation, Brooklyn's Joe Johnson hit a three - pointer that tied the game at 101 and sent the contest into its first overtime. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was the hero in the first overtime, tying the game at 111 with an 8 - foot jumper with 15 seconds on the clock. Joe Johnson came up big from three - point range once again in the second overtime, tying the game at 117 with 18 seconds on the clock.

Thaddeus Young contributed 24 points (8 - 20 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt), five rebounds, three assists and one steal. March has been a bad month for the Bucks. They've lost eight of their last ten. The Bucks have struggled offensively since dealing Brandon Knight to the Suns. They're shooting 43 percent from the field in his absence, down from 46 percent on the season. Recent injuries have exacerbated the situation. Jared Dudley (back) and O.J. Mayo (hamstring) were out against the Nets. Both have lingering injuries, and there's no definite timetable for their return. The Nets are also struggling. They've lost six of their last ten games. On Wednesday, they were blown out by the Cavaliers 117 - 92. The Bucks are currently sixth in the Eastern Conference, six games behind fifth - place Washington. The Nets are battling for a playoff spot, 2 games out of eighth place in the East, so Friday's game was a much - needed victory. The Bucks lead the season series 2 - 1.

The Houston Rockets defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, 115 - 88, at Wells Fargo Center on Monday. James Harden had no problem leading the Rockets (6 - 4) past the 76ers (1 - 9) on the road. The de facto leader of the Rockets commanded the floor and spread the court to his liking against a big man heavy Philadelphia squad. Houston took a 12 - point lead at the end of the first quarter and simply expanded on it, all the way up to as much as 30 points late in the second half. Philadelphia only managed eight points from halfway through the third quarter to the end of that period, which put the game completely out of reach. The bright spot for the 76ers continues to come from Joel Embiid, who played well over his 23 minutes, save for the six turnovers during that span. Embiid went on to score 13 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, blocked two shots and added one steal on 6 - of - 10 shooting. Harden led the way for Houston with 33 points, nine assists and seven rebounds on 12 - of - 20 shooting, including four three - pointers. Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza combined for 33 points to aid Harden in the blowout. Both teams play on Wednesday, as the Rockets visit the Oklahoma City Thunder, while the 76ers host the Washington Wizards.

The Washington Wizards defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 116 - 108, at Verizon Center on Thursday. The Wizards (29 - 20) have been a dominant team at home all season, having secured 20 of the 28 victories they'd come in to Thursday with at Verizon Center. However, they may have gotten more than they initially bargained for against a feisty Lakers (17 - 35) squad that battled back from a 58 - 44 halftime deficit. John Wall ultimately proved too much for the visitors, though, posting a 33 - point, 11 - assist double - double that also included three rebounds, three steals and one block. Los Angeles was also done in by its inability to take care of the ball, as they committed a whopping 20 turnovers. The Lakers were led by a 20 - point effort off the bench by Jordan Clarkson, which he complemented with two rebounds and an assist. D'Angelo Russell and Luol Deng posted matching 17 - point tallies, with the former adding 11 assists, seven rebounds, two steals and a block, and the latter hauling in six boards and posting a block. Tarik Black managed a 13 - point, 11 - rebound double - double that also included one assist. Lou Williams was productive in a reserve role as well, supplying 15 points, four assists, two rebounds and a block. Bradley Beal complemented Wall's effort with 23 points, four assists, a rebound, two steals and one block. Marcin Gortat submitted a 21 - point, 14 - rebound double - double that also included three assists and a steal. Markieff Morris also accomplished the feat, registering 12 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, three steals and two blocks. Otto Porter chipped in 11 points, six rebounds, three assists and two steals. The Lakers next head to Beantown to tangle with the Boston Celtics on Friday night, while the Wizards remain home to face the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday evening.

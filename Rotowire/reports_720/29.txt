The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 93 - 85, Wednesday at FedExForum. The Grizzlies (18 - 9) were back to full strength Wednesday after the return of Marc Gasol (rest), but the Cavaliers (18 - 6) were not, as head coach Tyronn Lue elected to rest his big three of Kevin Love, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Without them, Cleveland, as expected, had a tough time getting anything going on offense and Memphis took advantage. The Grizzlies seized control of the game from the very start and never let up, led by their big man in the middle Gasol, who posted a double - double of 17 points and 11 rebounds. However, the biggest performance of the night came unexpectedly off the bench from Troy Daniels, who scored an efficient 20 points in just 22 minutes. As a team, Memphis shot just 43 percent from the field but were on fire from long range, hitting 12 of their 23 shots from behind the arc. On the other hand, there was n't much to take away from this game for the Cavaliers since they played without their three best players. Their two top scorers both came off the bench Wednesday, with veteran sharpshooter James Jones scoring a team - high 15 points and rookie Kay Felder adding a career - high 14 points. Overall, though, it was a miserable shooting night for Cleveland, as they shot just 37 percent from the field overall and 64 percent from the free throw line. On top of that, they managed just 10 assists to their 12 turnovers. Up next, the Grizzlies will stay home Friday to take on the Kings, while the Cavaliers will have off until Saturday when they play the Lakers.

The visiting Orlando Magic took down the host Toronto Raptors on Sunday, 114 - 113. Orlando (19 - 30) bounced back from a 30 - point blowout loss at the hands of the Celtics for the win in Toronto on Sunday. Big man Nikola Vucevic led the team with 25 points and 10 rebounds against Toronto. Despite trailing early in the game, the Magic were able to come back and hold on to a lead for the entirety of the second. Orlando finished the first half on a 20 - 2 run, with Toronto making no field goals during the stretch. Point guard Elfrid Payton played a major piece in the Orlando offense, recording a double - double with 11 points and 10 assists. The Magic were red hot on Sunday, hitting over 53 percent of their shots from the field and making 10 three - pointers. Toronto (29 - 19) has struggled mightily of late, losing six of its last seven games. The Raptors, once solidly holding second place in the East, have slipped to third behind Cleveland and Boston in the standings. On Sunday, the clock was Toronto's greatest enemy, as the Raptors came to within one point of the win after trailing by 11 with two minutes left to play. Recently injured star DeMar DeRozan came back but looked rusty, as he shot just 6 - of - 18 on the night. All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry, however, led the team with an efficient 33 points and eight assists. Toronto will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday, while the Magic will visit the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday.

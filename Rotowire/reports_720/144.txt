The San Antonio Spurs (18 - 11) defeated the Los Angeles Clippers (19 - 9) 125 - 118 on Monday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio. The Spurs seemingly could not miss in this game, as they finished at 64 percent from the field and 56 percent from the three - point line. The Clippers shot decent at 50 percent from the field and 43 percent from beyond the arc, but it was n't enough to keep up with the electric Spurs team. The Spurs were led by Tony Parker, who shot 11 - for - 18 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 26 points, while also adding four assists. It was Parker's first game in over week after dealing with a hamstring injury, and he came back firing with a huge night on the offensive side of the ball. Tim Duncan also had a strong showing, scoring 21 points and recording 12 rebounds. It was his third double - double in a row, as he's averaged 25 points and 13 rebounds over those three games. The Spurs also had a lot of help off the bench from both Manu Ginobili and Boris Diaw. Ginobili finished with 19 points (7 - 11 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and 10 assists, while Diaw recorded 23 points (9 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 8 FT) and six rebounds. With that kind of production, the Spurs may be impossible to beat. Despite a ridiculous shooting performance from the Spurs, the Clippers kept it close with Blake Griffin, JJ Redick and Chris Paul all scoring over 20 points. Paul led the way with 25 points (8 - 17 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt, 6 - 7 FT) and nine assists. Over the last two games he's combined for 52 points and 18 rebounds, as he's stayed hot on the offensive side of the ball. Griffin finished with 22 points (10 - 20 FG, 2 - 4 FT), six rebounds and six assists. Griffin did a little bit of everything in this one, pushing his season averages to 23 points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists per game. Redick shot 6 - for - 13 from the field and 5 - for - 8 from beyond the arc to score 25 points. It was his second game in a row scoring over 20 points, despite averaging only 15 points on the year. Jamal Crawford also played well, scoring 18 points (6 - 15 FG, 0 - 5 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) off the bench. The Spurs' next game will be at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, while the Clippers will travel to Atlanta to play the Hawks on Tuesday.

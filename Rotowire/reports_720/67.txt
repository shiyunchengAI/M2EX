The visiting Cleveland Cavaliers demolished the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, 126 - 94. For Cleveland (15 - 5), the win comes as a major shift of momentum. The Cavs had lost three in a row headed into their matchup in Toronto on Monday, but have won twice this week on the road against stiff competition. On Wednesday, the Cavaliers showed why they are the reigning champions, destroying the Knicks by 32 points to snap New York's four - game win streak. The "big three" of LeBron James, Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving combined for 74 points and 15 assists, helping to lead the team to the blowout victory. Big man Tristan Thompson, meanwhile, posted a goose egg in the scoring column but delivered a whopping 20 rebounds, including six offensive boards. Despite the absence of sharpshooting guard J.R. Smith (knee), the Cavs hit 22 three - pointers while rolling to the easy win. For New York (12 - 10), meanwhile, the loss brought the team's four - game win streak to an abrupt halt. The Knicks saw below - average production almost across the board, as star Carmelo Anthony scored just eight points and rising star Kristaps Porzingis shot just 5 - of - 15. While Cleveland shot almost 49 percent, the Knicks barely cracked 40 from the field. New York also managed just half as many three - pointers as Cleveland did, hitting only 11 - of - 31 from beyond the arc. On Friday, the Cavs will host the Miami Heat while the Knicks will travel to Sacramento to play the Kings.

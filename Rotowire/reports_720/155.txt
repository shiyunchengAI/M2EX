The San Antonio Spurs (55 - 26) defeated the Phoenix Suns (39 - 42) 107 - 91 on Sunday at the AT & T Center in San Antonio. The Spurs continued their unbelievable stretch, winning their eleventh game in a row and propelling themselves into the second spot in the Western Conference standings. After many had criticized the defending champs for their slow start to the season, the Spurs have made them eat their words, as they now own a half game lead over the Clippers, Grizzlies and Rockets for that second projected playoff seed. The Spurs were the superior shooters in this game, going 51 percent from the field and 42 percent from the three - point line, while the Suns finished at 41 percent from the floor and just 25 percent from deep. It was the Spurs' frontcourt duo of Tim Duncan and Kawhi Leonard that helped seal the victory Sunday. Duncan finished with 22 points (7 - 11 FG, 8 - 9 FT), 10 rebounds and two blocked shots, while playing just 26 minutes. It was a very efficient showing for the veteran, who's posted two double - doubles in a row. During that two - game stretch, he's combined for 51 points and 20 rebounds, so Duncan is doing a great job of building even more momentum for himself as they head into the playoffs. Leonard, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to score 18 points, to go along with nine rebounds. He's had a fantastic span of games throughout April, averaging 20 points over seven games. He's also done it defensively though, posting three or more steals in four out of those seven games as well. The Spurs received some solid contributions off their bench. Cory Joseph had 13 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and four rebounds over 19 minutes, while Marco Belinelli posted 13 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 3 FT) and four assists over 24 minutes. Eric Bledsoe and Gerald Green were the only two Suns' players that really had any success against the Spurs' defense. Bledsoe notched a double - double with 20 points (7 - 13 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) and 10 assists. He's now combined for 39 points and 17 assists over his last three games. Green, on the other hand, went 8 - for - 16 from the field and 2 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score 23 points, while also adding four rebounds over 26 minutes. Over his last five games, he's now averaging 19 points, as he's been one of the few bright spots for the Suns. Markieff Morris and Archie Goodwin were the only other two players to reach double figures. Morris finished with 12 points (4 - 10 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) and five rebounds, while Goodwin recorded 11 points (5 - 15 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and four rebounds. The Spurs' next game will be on the road against the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday, while the Suns will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday.

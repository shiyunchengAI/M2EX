The Toronto Raptors (38 - 22) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (13 - 47) 114 - 103 on Monday at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Both teams shot surprisingly well in this one, with the Raptors finishing at 51 percent from the field and 41 percent from the three - point line, while the Sixers went 53 percent from the floor and 40 percent from deep. Despite an evenly played game, the Raptors forced the Sixers into 16 turnovers, while committing just 11 of their own, which may have made just enough of a difference to push the Raptors to a victory on the road in Philadelphia on Monday. Leading the Raptors was DeMar DeRozan, who was nearly unstoppable in this one. He went 12 - for - 24 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while also adding nine rebounds and five assists. DeRozan also forced his way to the free throw line, and converted on a perfect 10 - of - 10 attempts. After shooting less than 30 percent over his last two games, he finally got things turned around and exploded for a new season - high in points. With Kyle Lowry sitting out on a day of rest, Greivis Vasquez started at the point, finishing with 12 points (5 - 8 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt) and five assists. It was his eighteenth start of the season, as he's now pushed his season averages to 10 points and 4 assists on the year. The Raptors also got a huge boost from their bench though. Louis Williams went off for 21 points (6 - 15 FG, 2 - 9 3Pt, 7 - 7 FT) and five assists in 30 minutes, while Patrick Patterson added 15 points (6 - 10 FG, 2 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 29 minutes.

He also added seven rebounds and two steals. Over his last three games, he's now averaging 14 points and 11 rebounds, as he continues to improve as the season wears on. Coming off the bench, Ish Smith finished with 19 points (8 - 13 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), five rebounds and nine assists. It was far - and - away his best game since joining the Sixers at the trade deadline. Over his first five games since joining Philadelphia, he's averaging 10 points and six assists.

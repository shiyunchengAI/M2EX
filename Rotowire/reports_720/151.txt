The Sacramento Kings defeated the Los Angeles Lakers,116-92, at Golden 1 Center on Monday. The Kings (9 - 15) came away with a blowout win to snap a three - game losing streak, but it took its toll on the home team, as they lost Rudy Gay (hip flexor) and Ben McLemore (quad) during the game. Before the two injuries, the physical battle between DeMarcus Cousins and Julius Randle caused Lakers (10 - 17) head coach Luke Walton to get ejected after arguing a controversial no call on Cousins. Both players went to the ground, and it appeared that Cousins had some part in pulling Randle down with him near the top of the key, off the ball. Los Angeles got some life following the ejection and used it to finish the half with a nine - point lead. DeMarcus Cousins bounced back on his own to lead the third quarter Kings surge, where the big man had a major part in outscoring the Lakers 39 - 13 during that period. Los Angeles had no response following the big scoring run for Sacramento. The Lakers are now on a seven - game losing streak. Cousins finished with 31 points, 16 rebounds, five assists, two steals and three blocks to round out his monstrous performance. The Kings all - star center went 12 - of - 21 shooting, including 2 - of - 3 from behind the arc. Darren Collison aided Cousins in the scoring department with 20 points, while Garrett Temple led the bench with 16 points. Louis Williams broke his streak of five straight games with at least 20 points after finishing with 14 points on 3 - of - 12 shooting in 26 minutes off the bench. D'Angelo Russell led Los Angeles and looked more mobile with the hindering knee injury slowly dwindling away, and finished with 17 points, two rebounds and four assists on 6 - of - 10 shooting. Both teams are on the road on Wednesday, as the Lakers visit the Brooklyn Nets and the Kings visit the Houston Rockets.

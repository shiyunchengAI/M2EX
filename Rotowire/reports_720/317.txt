The San Antonio Spurs (34 - 6) extended their winning streak to nine with a victory Wednesday over the Detroit Pistons (21 - 17) at The Palace of Auburn Hills, 109 - 99. The Spurs exploded for a 29 - 19 second quarter to take a nine - point halftime lead, a lead they would hold for the rest of the game. San Antonio point guard Tony Parker had scored 20 points just three times all season, but he exploded for a season - high 31 points on a brilliant 13 - 19 shooting to lead the Spurs to victory. Parker was supported by a double - double from power forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who dropped 22 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. Manu Ginobili came off the bench to score an efficient 15 points (5 - 12 shooting) and collect five rebounds in 27 minutes. The Spurs shot a healthy 41 - 85 (48 percent) from the field despite an off game from Kawhi Leonard (seven points, 1 - 7 shooting). Kentavious Caldwell-Pope knocked down four three - pointers and led the Pistons with 25 points in the losing effort. Andre Drummond picked up his fourth double - double in the past five games with 17 points and 10 rebounds, and backup big man Aron Baynes scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds in just 19 minutes. The Pistons shot poorly, however - - 42 percent from the floor and just 6 - 23 (26 percent) from three - - and were n't able to overcome the Spurs efficient attack. San Antonio returns home from the two - game road trip Friday to take on the Cavaliers. Detroit will head on the road to Memphis for a Friday night contest.

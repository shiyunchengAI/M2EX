The host Memphis Grizzlies shut down the powerhouse San Antonio Spurs, 89 - 74, at FedExForum Arena on Monday. Defense was the key for the Grizzlies (32 - 22), who held the Spurs to just 36 percent shooting and a season - low scoring output. The absence of Spurs superstar Kawhi Leonard (quad) certainly helped the Grizzlies' case, but it was a stunning defensive performance nonetheless. The "Grit and Grind" Grizz blocked a whopping 11 shots on the night, including three off the bench from big man Brandan Wright. Though the Grizz struggled on offense, hitting just four three - pointers and shooting under 40 percent, the team forced an even tougher night for its opponent. Memphis forced an unusual 16 turnovers from the Spurs. San Antonio (39 - 12) remains the league's second - best team, but certainly could have used Leonard's offense on Monday. In his absence, the team's high scorer was bench veteran David Lee, who contributed only 14 points in 17 minutes of play. It was a particularly off night for San Antonio in terms of ball movement, as the team recorded only 11 assists on the night. The Spurs hit just four three - pointers and were unable to match the defensive intensity of their tough opponent. The Spurs will visit Philadelphia on Wednesday, while Memphis will host the Suns.

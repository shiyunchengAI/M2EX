Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns overpowered the Kings defense in a rather easy road victory for Minnesota, a team that's been far from strong on the road this season. Wiggins finished with 27 points, four rebounds and one assist on 10 - of - 22 shooting, while Towns added 29 points, 17 rebounds, two assists and three blocks. Nemanja Bjelica put up a strong bench performance in his 35 minutes, as he posted 10 points and 12 boards. All five Kings starters did finish in double figures in scoring, with three tying for the team lead of 14 points. Kosta Koufos, Ben McLemore and Willie Cauley-Stein each had 14 points, while Darren Collison and Ty Lawson pitched in 10 points and 11 points, respectively. Newcomer Tyreke Evans played 25 minutes off the bench and scored 13 points, to go with five rebounds and two assists.

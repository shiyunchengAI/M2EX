Louis Williams has been a bright spot for the injury - riddled Los Angeles Lakers, although his scoring outbursts are not translating into wins for the team at the moment. In five of the six games that the Lakers have lost during their rough streak, Williams has scored at least 24 points, adding another 24 - point game against the Knicks. It actually falls on the lower end of the scoring spectrum for Williams in his increased minutes, as three of those games he scored at least 30 points. As for the Knicks, Kristaps Porzingis played both ends of the floor effectively, racking up 26 points, to go along with 12 rebounds, two assists and seven blocks on 8 - of - 15 shooting. While Carmelo Anthony only managed 13 points on 16 shots, Derrick Rose (back) bailed him out with one of his best performances in a Knicks uniform, scoring 25 points on 12 - of - 16 shooting.

The Miami Heat (23 - 30) defeated the New York Knicks (10 - 44) 111 - 87 on Friday. Goran Dragic was acquired from the Suns in a deadline deal on Thursday. He was unavailable Friday night but the move may have sparked a fire under Mario Chalmers. Chalmers shot just 4 - of - 14 from the floor but had seven assists, six rebounds and eight steals. Shabazz Napier also had a nice game. The rookie had 18 points, six assists and seven rebounds, but he did turn the ball over seven times. The Heat got some bad news late Thursday night about the condition of Chris Bosh. Bosh has a blood clot and could potentially miss the remainder of the season. Miami banded together and eight of their nine players scored at least 12 points in the blowout victory. The Knicks lost out on the Goran Dragic sweepstakes to the Heat on Thursday and then lost to Miami on Friday. Langston Galloway continues to be one of the few bright spots for New York this season. He led his team with 19 points on 7 - of - 14 shooting. Tim Hardaway led all reserves with 17 points in 30 minutes. The Knicks have dropped six straight and are currently the NBA's worst team. The Heat will take on the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday in a matchup with the recently departed Norris Cole. The Knicks will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday.

With George Hill missing his first game in a Jazz uniform with a sprained thumb, a pair of reliable veterans and his replacements at point guard keyed a double - digit road victory. Gordon Hayward's 20 - point haul led the way, while Derrick Favors posted season highs with 16 points and 14 boards. The point guard duo of Shelvin Mack and Dante Exum combined for 19 points, five assists, two rebounds and a pair of steals. Utah also managed respective 51 and 58 percent success rates from the field and behind the arc, respectively. The Sixers' big - man tandem of Jahil Okafor and Joel Embiid contributed respective tallies of 15 and 14 points. However, Robert Covington and Ersan Ilyasova were the only others to manage double - digit scoring on a night when Philadelphia shot 40 percent overall and committed 18 turnovers.

The Mavericks (23 - 10) beat the Wizards (22 - 9) in blowout fashion Tuesday by a score of 114 - 87. In a game that featured one of the league's best offenses in the Mavericks pitted against one of the league's stingiest defenses in the Wizards, offense prevailed as Dallas led by 20 points for the majority of the second half. The Mavericks shot lights - out, hitting 52 percent from the floor and 53 percent from beyond the arc. Dallas had six players score in double figures, led by Monta Ellis with 20 points. Washington was coming off of a tight game Monday against the Rockets that came down to the final minute. That certainly did n't help their cause as the Wizards were out of contention for much of this game. Washington is an even 1 - 1 on their Western Conference road trip but will get two days off before taking the floor again Friday against the Thunder. Dallas has won three straight. They have the next two days off before starting a road trip that begins against the Boston Celtics on Friday.

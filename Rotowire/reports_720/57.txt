The Utah Jazz (13 - 16) defeated the Philadelphia 76ers (2 - 31) 95 - 91 on Monday. The Philadelphia 76ers may only have two wins on their lowly season, but recently acquired point guard Ish Smith has provided a spark in the backcourt for the NBA’s last place team. A semblance of offense looks to be in motion with Smith at the helm, as the 76ers overcame a 58 - 45 halftime deficit, and were competitive through the last possessions of the game. Smith finished with 22 points and dished out 11 assists on 8 - of - 21 shooting in 32 minutes. The Wake Forest product made a beautiful move to get a solid look to tie the game with the shot clock turned off in the 4th quarter, but the shot did not fall. JaKarr Sampson got the start in favor of the injured Jahlil Okafor (knee) and provided six points and five rebounds in 19 minutes. Nerlens Noel was effective under the rim, as the big man blocked five shots, to go along with 18 points and six rebounds. Richaun Holmes also contributed 18 points in the losing effort. Philadelphia could not find a rhythm from 3 - point territory, shooting 24 percent as a unit. The 76ers will visit the Sacramento Kings (12 - 18) on Wednesday. The Jazz earned a tough win, even after storming out to a 21 point lead in the first half. Gordon Hayward put forth a volume effort, and although his percentage was not in the realm of efficiency, his 3 - pointer in the final :30 gave Utah the lead, and eventually, the win. Hayward led all scorers with 24 points, to go along with six rebounds and four assists on 6 - of - 21 shooting. Jeff Withey drew the start, as Derrick Favors (back) sat his second consecutive game. Withey added a double - double in the win, scoring 11 points and bringing in 12 rebounds in 23 minutes. Utah did the majority of their damage from the free throw line, nailing 32 - of - 36 from the charity stripe, which made up for the horrid 33 percent shooting from the field. Trey Burke led the bench with 14 points. The Jazz head to Minnesota to face the struggling Timberwolves (11 - 20) on Wednesday.

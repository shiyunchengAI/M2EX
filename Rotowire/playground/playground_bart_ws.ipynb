The Lakers' defense, which struggled all season, was surprsingly the key to the comeback, as it held the Jazz to just 39 points in the second half. The third - leading scorer in NBA history, Bryant became the oldest player to score 50 points in a game as he posted the fifth - highest scoring game of his career. Trey Lyles led the Jazz with 18 points, 11 rebounds and five steals. Gordon Hayward, who finished with 17 points, had the unfortunate task of covering Bryant. The Jazz were eliminated from the playoffs just before tip - off when the Houston Rockets beat the Sacramento Kings, the fourth consecutive season Utah has missed the playoffs. It marks the Jazz's longest playoff drought since 1980 - 83. With 12 points Jordan Clarkson was the only other player in double figures for the Lakers, who have missed the playoffs a franchise - high three straight seasons.\"\n",
